The weaponson your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.OBI-WAN : And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, YourHighness, he will return with another droid army.PADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everythingdepends on it.INT.

The two Jedi may beusing the Queen for their own purposes.DARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect theQueen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant....

I don't likejust waiting here for something tohappen to her.OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed.OBI-WANWhat's going on?ANAKIN shrugs.ANAKINShe covered that camera. I don'tthink she liked me watching her.OBI-WANWhat is she thinking?ANAKINShe programmed Artoo to warn us ifthere's an intruder.OBI-WANIt's not an intruder I'm worriedabout. There are many other waysto kill a Senator.ANAKINI know, but we also want to catchthis assassin. Don't we, Master?OBI-WANYou're using her as bait??ANAKINIt was her idea... No harm willcome to her. I can senseeverything going on in that room.Trust me.OBI-WANIt's too risky... and your sensesaren't that attuned, youngapprentice.ANAKINAnd yours are?OBI-WANPossibly.INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHTAs PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME.INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHTANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment.OBI-WAN You look tired.ANAKINI don't sleep well, anymore.OBI-WAN Because of your mother?ANAKINI don't know why I keep dreamingAbout her now. I haven't seen hersince I was little.OBI-WANDreams pass in time.ANAKINI'd rather dream of PadmE. JustBeing around her again is...intoxicating.OBI-WANMind your thoughts, Anakin, theybetray you. You've made acommitment to the Jedi order... acommitment not easily broken...and don't forget she's apolitician. They're not to betrusted.ANAKIN She's not like the others in theSenate, Master.OBI-WANIt's been my experience thatSenators are only focused onpleasing those who fund theircampaigns... and they are morethan willing to forget theniceties of democracy to get thosefunds.ANAKINNot another lecture, Master. Noton the economics of politics....It's too early in the morning... andbesides, you're generalising. TheChancellor doesn't appear tobe corrupt.OBI-WANPalpatine's a politician, I'veobserved that he is very clever atfollowing the passions andprejudices of the Senators.ANAKINI think he is a good man. Myinstincts are very positiveabout...ANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WANOBI-WANI sense it, too.INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHTARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHTOBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHTANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.ANAKINStay here!CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHTThe PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off. EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHTANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHTThe DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.OBI-WANI have a bad feeling about this.FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.ANAKINThat was wacky! I almost lost youin the traffic.OBI-WANWhat took you so long?ANAKINOh, you know, Master, I couldn'tfind a speeder I really liked,with an open cockpit... and withthe right speed capabilities...and then you know I had to get areally gonzo color...They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.OBI-WANIf you'd spend as much timeworking on your saber skills asyou do on your wit, young Padawan,you would rival Master Yoda as aswordsman.ANAKINI thought I already did.OBI-WANOnly in your mind, my very youngapprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.ANAKINSorry, I forgot you don't likeflying, Master.OBI-WANI don't mind flying... butwhat you're doing is suicide!They barely miss a commuter trainANAKINMaster, you know I've been flyingsince before I could walk. I'm verygood at this.OBI-WANJust slow down!ZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.OBI-WAN(continuing)Wait! Don't go in there!ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.OBI-WAN(continuing)You know I don't like it when youdo that!ANAKINSorry, Master. Don't worry, thisguy's gonna kill himself anyminute now!ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.OBI-WANWhat are you doing? He's gonnablast me!ANAKINRight - this isn't working.ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.OBI-WANThat was too close!ANAKINClear that!OBI-WANWhat??ANAKINClear the flag! We're losingpower! Hurry!OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.OBI-WANWhooooaaa! Don't do that! Idon't like it when you do that!ANAKINSo sorry, Master.They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.OBI-WANIt's dangerous near those powercouplings! Slow down! Don't gothrough there!Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.OBI-WAN(continuing)Yiiii, what are you doing?ANAKINSorry, Master!OBI-WAN(sarcastically)Oh, that was good...ANAKINThat was crazy!!!ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.ANAKIN(continuing)Ahh, damn.OBI-WANStop!!ANAKINNo, we can make it.ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.OBI-WANI'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'mcrazy.ANAKINBut it worked... we made it.OBI-WAN(angrily)It didn't work... we've stalled!And you almost got us killed!ANAKINI think we're still alive.ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.OBI-WAN(very angrily)It was stupid!ANAKIN(sheepishly)I could have made it...OBI-WAN(furious)But you didn't!!! And now we'velost him.Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.ANAKINNo we didn t...Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the rightOBI-WANWhere are you going?! He wentdown there, the other way.ANAKINThis is a shortcut... I think.OBI-WANWhat do you mean,  You think? What kind of shortcut?! He wentcompletely the other way! You velost him!ANAKINMaster, if we keep this chasegoing, that creep s gonna end updeep fried. Personally, I d verymuch like to find out who in thehell he is and who he s workingfor...OBI-WAN(sarcastic)Oh, so that s why we re going inthe wrong direction.ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.OBI-WAN(continuing)Well, you lost him.ANAKINI m deeply sorry, Master.ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.ANAKIN(continuing)Excuse me for a moment.ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zam s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeder s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.OBI-WAN has jumped into the driver s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger s seat.ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAM S hand. She grabs the Jedi s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of it s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter s speeder.Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHTZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.OBI-WANAnakin!ANAKINShe went into that club, Master.OBI-WANPatience.OBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.OBI-WAN (continuing)Here. Next time try not to lose it.ANAKINSorry, Master.ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.OBI-WANA Jedi's saber is his mostprecious possession.ANAKINYes, Master.He reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.OBI-WANHe must keep it with him at alltimes.ANAKINI know, Master.OBI-WANThis weapon is your life!ANAKINI've heard this lesson before...OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.OBI-WANBut, you haven't learned anything,Anakin.ANAKINI try, Master.INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHTOBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at themOBI-WANWhy do I think you are going to bethe death of me?!ANAKINDon't say that Master... You'rethe closest thing I have to afather... I love you. I don't wantto cause you pain.OBI-WANThen why don't you listen to me?!ANAKINI will. I'll do better, I promise.OBI-WANDo you see him him?ANAKINI think he's a she...OBI-WANThen be extra careful...(nods to a room)Check it out.OBI-WAN goes away.ANAKINWhere are you going, Master?OBI-WANTo get a drink.OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.CLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANOWanna buy some death sticks?OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.OBI-WANYou don't want to sell me death-sticks.ELANI don't want to sell you death-sticks.OBI-WAN moves his fingers.OBI-WANYou want to go home and rethink your life.ELANI want to go home and rethink mylife.He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.CLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.ANAKINEasy... Official business. Goback to your drinks.Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHTOBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods.OBI-WANDo you know who it was you weretrying to kill?ZAM WESSELThe Senator from Naboo.OBI-WANWho hired you?ZAM glares at OBI-WAN.ZAM WESSELIt was just a job.ANAKINTell us!ZAM WESSELThat Senator's gonna die soonanyway, and the next one won'tmake the same mistake I did...OBI-WANThis wound's going to needtreatment.ANAKINWho hired you? Tell us... tell usnow!ZAM glares hatefully.ZAMIt was a Bounty Hunter called...There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in surprise and dies.There is a WEOOSH from above. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up yo see an ARMOURED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above. OBI-WAN looks down at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking dart.OBI-WANToxic Dart...INT.

As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling smile... PADME is in a very bad mood.PADMEI do not like this idea of hiding.ANAKINDon't worry. Now that the Councilhas ordered an investigation, itwon't take Master Obi-Wan long tofind that bounty hunter.PADME(frustrated)I haven't worked for a year todefeat the "Military Creation Act"not to be here when its fate isdecided.ANAKINSometimes we have to let go of ourpride and do what is requested ofus.PADMEPride?!?

He becomes a little shy.ANAKINMaster Obi-Wan manages not to seeit...PADMEMentors have a way of seeing moreof our faults than we would like.It's the only way we grow.ANAKINDon't get me wrong... Obi-Wan isa great mentor. As wise as MasterYoda and as powerful as MasterWindu. I am truly thankful to behis apprentice. Only... althoughI'm a Padawan learner, in someways... a lot of ways... I'm aheadof him. I'm ready for the trials.I know I am! He knows it too.

DORME laughs in the background.PADMEI didn't say it to hurt you.ANAKINI know...There is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN.PADMEAnakin...They look into each other's eyes for the first time.PADME(continuing)Don't try to grow up too fast.ANAKINI am grown up.

A PK-4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console.PK-4Place the subject for analysis onthe sensot tray, please.OBI-WAN puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console. The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of OBI-WAN.OBI-WANIt's a toxic dart. I need to knowwhere it came from and who made it.PK-4One moment, please.Diagrams and .... appear on the screem, scrolling past at great speed. OBI-WAN watches as the screen goes blank.

STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAYThe great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings. To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.SERVERKeep moving! Keep moving!ARTOO slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. A SERVER sees him.FOOD SERVER(continuing)Hey! No Droids!ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless.ANAKINNo, no, Mom, no...He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.ANAKIN(continuing)What?PADMEYou seemed to be having anightmare.ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.PADME(continuing)Are you hungry?ANAKINThank you.PADMEWe went into lightspeed a whileago.ANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes.ANAKINI look forward to seeing Nabooagain. I've thought about it everyday since I left. It's by far themost beautiful place I've everseen...PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare. PADMEYou were just a little boy then.It may not be as you remember it;time changes your perception.ANAKINI think time has given me muchmore mature feelings to enhance myperception.PADMEIt must be difficult having swornyour life to the Jedi... not beingable to visit the places youlike... or do the things youlike...ANAKINOr be with the people I love.PADMEAre you allowed to love? Ithought that was forbidden for aJedi.ANAKINAttachment is forbidden.Possession is forbidden.Compassion, which I would defineas unconditional love, is centralto a Jedi's life, so you might saywe're encouraged to love.PADMEYou have changed so muchANAKINYou haven't changed a bit. You'reexactly the way I remember you inmy dreams. I doubt if Naboo haschanged much either.PADMEIt hasn't...ANAKINI can't wait to breathe the sweetbreeze that comes off the rollinghills. Whenever I try tovisualise the Force, those hillsare what I see.ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.ANAKIN(continuing)I love Naboo.There is an awkward moment.PADME(changing the subject)Were you dreaming about youmother earlier, weren't you?ANAKINYes... I left Tatooine so longago, my memory of her is fading.I don't want to lose it. RecentlyI've been seeing her in mydreams... vivid dreams... scarydreams. I worry about her.PADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNINGOBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through.OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windowa it says "DEX'S DINER" in alien lettering. He goes inside.INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNINGA young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window.

Be right with ya!OBI-WAN sits in a booth.HERMIONE BAGWAYou want a cup of ardees?OBI-WANThank you.HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER appears. He is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely.DEXTER JETTSTERHey, ol' buddy!OBI-WANHey, Dex.DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just make it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them.DEXTER JETTSTERSo, my friend. What can I do forya?OBI-WANYou can tell me what this is.OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX'S eyes widen. He puts down his mug.DEXTER JETTSTERWell, whattaya know...DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.DEXTER JETTSTER(continuing)I ain't seen one of these since Iwas prospecting on Subterrelbeyond the Outer Rim!OBI-WANDo you know where it came from?DEXTER grins. He puts the dart down between them.DEXTER JETTSTERThis baby belongs to them cloners.What you got here is a KaminoKyberdart.OBI-WANKamino Kyberdart... I wonder whyit didn't show up in any analysisarchive.DEXTER JETTSTERIt's these funny little cuts onthe side give it away...Those analysis droids you've gotover there only focus on symbols,you know. I should think you Jediwould have more respect for thedifference between knowledge andwisdom.OBI-WANWell, Dex, if droids could think, wewouldn't be here, would we?(laughing)Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.Is it part of the Republic?DEXTER JETTSTERNo, it's beyond the Outer Rim.I'd say about twelve parsecsoutside the Rishi Maze, toward thesouth. It should be easy to find,even for those droids in yourarchive to find. Those Kaminoanskeep to themselves. They'recloners. Damned good ones, too.OBI-WAN then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.OBI-WANCloners? Are they friendly?DEXTER JETTSTERIt depends.OBI-WANOn what, Dex?Dexter grins. DEXTER JETTSTEROn how good your manners are...and how big your pocketbook is...EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT - DAYThe Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.PADME, ANAKIN and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the Starfreighter and into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main plaza.EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOONThe speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.ANAKINIf I grew up here, I don't thinkI'd ever leave.PADME(laughing)I doubt that.ANAKINNo, really. When I started mytraining, I was very homesick andvery lonely. This city and my Momwere the only pleasant things Ihad to think about... The problemwas, the more I thought about myMom, the worse I felt. But Iwould feel better if I thoughtabout the palace - the way itshimmers in the sunlight - the waythe air always smells of flowers...PADME...and the soft sound of thedistant waterfalls. The firsttime I saw the Capital, I was veryyoung... I'd never seen awaterfall before. I though theywere so beautiful... I neverdreamed one day I'd live in thepalace.ANAKINWell, tell me, did you dream ofpower and politics when you werea little girl?PADME(laughing)No! That was the last thing Ithought of. My dream was to helpin the "Refugee Relief Movement."I never thought of running forelected office. But the morehistory I studied, the more Irealised how much good politicianscould do. So when I was eight, Ijoined the "ApprenticeLegislators", then later on becamea Senatorial advisor, with such apassion that, before I knew it, Iwas elected Queen. Partly becauseI scored so high on my educationcertificate, but for the most partit was my conviction that reformwas possible. I wasn't theyoungest Queen ever elected, butnow that I think back on it, I'mnot sure I was old enough. I'm notsure I was ready.ANAKINThe people you served thought youdid a good job. I heard theytried to amend the Constitution soyou could stay in office.PADMEPopular rule is not democracy,Annie. It gives the people whatthey want, not what they need.And, truthfully, I was relievedwhen my two terms were up. Sowere my parents. They worriedAbout me during the blockade andcouldn't wait for it all to beover. Actually, I was hoping tohave a family by now... Mysisters have the most amazing,wonderful kids... but when theQueen asked me to serve asSenator, I couldn't refuse her.ANAKINI agree! I think the Republicneeds you... I'm glad you choseto serve. I feel things are goingto happen in our generation thatwill change the galaxy in profoundways.PADMEI think so too.ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOONQUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors.QUEEN JAMILLIAWe've been worried about you.(takes her hand)I'm so glad you're safe, PadmE.PADMEThank you, Your Highness. I onlyWish I could have served youbetter by staying on Coruscant forthe vote.SIO BIBBLEGiven the circumstances, Senator,you know it was the only decisionHer Highness could have made.QUEEN JAMILLIAHow many systems have joined CountDooku and the separatists?PADMEAbout two hundred. And more areleaving the Republic every day.If the Senate votes to create anarmy, I'm sure it's going to pushus into a civil war.SIO BIBBLEIt's unthinkable! There hasn'tbeen a full-scale war since theformation of the Republic!QUEEN JAMILLIADo you see any way, throughnegotiations, to bring theseparatists back into the Republic?PADMENot if they feel threatened. Theseparatists don't have an army,but if they are provoked, theywill move to defend themselves.I'm sure of that. And with no timeor money to build an army, myguess is they will turn to theCommerce Guilds or the TradeFederation for help.QUEEN JAMILLIAThe armies of commerce! Why hasNothing been done in the Senateto restrain them?PADMEI'm afraid that, despite theChancellor's best efforts, thereare still many bureaucrats,judges, and even Senators on thepayrolls of the Guilds.SIO BIBBLEIt's outrageous! After all ofthose hearings, and the four trials inthe Supreme Court, Nute Gunray isstill the Viceroy of the TradeFederation. Do those moneymongers control everything?QUEEN JAMILLIARemember, Counsellor, the courtswere able to reduce theFederation's armies. That's amove in the rightdirection.PADMEThere are rumours, Your Highness,that the Federation Army was notreduced as they were ordered.ANAKINThe Jedi have not been allowed toinvestigate. It would be to be toodangerous for the economy, we weretold.QUEEN JAMILLIAWe must keep our faith in theRepublic. The day we stopbelieving democracy can work isthe day we lose it.PADMELet's pray that day never comes.QUEEN JAMILLIAIn the meantime, we must consideryour own safety.SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.SIO BIBBLE(to Anakin)What is your suggestion, MasterJedi?PADMEAnakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.He's still a Padawan learner. Iwas thinking...ANAKIN(nettled)Hey, hold on a minute!PADMEExcuse me! I was thinking I wouldstay in the Lake Country. Thereare some places up there that arevery isolated.ANAKINExcuse me?! I am in charge ofsecurity here, M'Lady.SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here.PADMEAnnie, my life is at risk, andthis is my home. I know it verywell... that is why we're here.I think it would be wise for youto take advantage of my knowledgein this instance.ANAKIN(takes a deep breath)Sorry, M'Lady.SIO BIBBLE(to Anakin, amused)She is right. The Lake Country isthe most remote part of Naboo.Not many people and a clear viewof the surrounding terrain.QUEEN JAMILLIAPerfect. It's settled then.ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave.QUEEN JAMILLIA(continued)PadmE, I had an audience with yourfather yesterday. I told him whatwas happening. He hopes you willvisit your mother before youleave... your family's veryworried about you.PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase.EXT.

JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAYA bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.JOCASTA NUDid you call for assistance?OBI-WAN(distracted in thought)Yes... yes, I did...JOCASTA NUHe has a powerful face, doesn'the? He was one of the mostbrilliant Jedi I have had theprivilege of knowing.OBI-WANI never understood why he quit.Only twenty Jedi have ever leftthe Order.JOCASTA NU(sighs)The Lost Twenty... and Count Dookuwas the most recent and the mostpainful. No one likes to talkabout it. His leaving was a greatloss to the Order.OBI-WANWhat happened?JOCASTA NUWell, one might say, he was alwaysa bit out of step with thedecisions of the Council... muchlike your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.OBI-WAN(surprised)Really?JOCASTA NUOh, yes. They were alike in manyways. Very individual thinkers...idealists...JOCASTA NU stares at the bustJOCASTA NU(continuingHe was always striving to becomea more powerful Jedi. He wantedto be the best. With a lightsaber,in the old style of fencing, hehad no match. His knowledge ofthe Force was... unique. In theend, I think he left because helost faith in the Republic. Hebelieved that politics werecorrupt, and he felt the Jedibetrayed themselves by serving thepoliticians. He always had veryhigh expectations of government.He disappeared for nine or tenyears, then he just showed uprecently as the head of theseparatist movement.OBI-WANInteresting... I'm still not sureI understand.JOCASTA NUWell, I'm sure you didn't call meover here for a history lesson.Are you having a problem, MasterKenobi?OBI-WANYes, I'm trying to find a planetsystem called Kamino. It doesn'tseem to show upon any of thearchive charts.JOCASTA NUKamino? It's not a system I'Mfamiliar with... Let me see...JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.JOCASTA NU(continuing)Are you sure you have the rightco-ordinates?OBI-WAN(nodding)According to my information, itshould be in this quadrantsomewhere... just south of theRishi Maze.JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.JOCASTA NUNo co-ordinates? It sounds like thekind of directions you'd get froma street tout... some old miner orFurbog trader.OBI-WANAll three actually.JOCASTA NUAre you sure it exists?OBI-WANAbsolutely.JOCASTA NULet me do a gravitational scan.OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU studt the star map hologram.JOCASTA NUThere are some inconsistencieshere. Maybe the planet you'relooking for was destroyed.OBI-WANWouldn't that be on record?JOCASTA NUIt ought to be. Unless it was veryrecent.(shakes her head)I hate to say it, but it lookslike the system you're searchingfor doesn't exist.OBI-WANThat's impossible... perhaps thearchives are incomplete.JOCASTA NUThe archives are comprehensive andtotally secure, my young Jedi.One thing you may be absolutelysure of - if an item does notappear in our records, it does notexist!OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back at the map.EXT.

She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.PADMEThat was when I went with theRelief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.Their sun was imploding, and theplanet was dying.

Gatherround the map reader, younglings.Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.Find it, we will try...The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.OBI-WANThis is where it ought to be...but it isn t. Gravity is pullingall the stars in this area inwardto this spot. There should be astar here... but there isn t.YODAMost interesting. Gravity ssilhouette remains, but the starand all its planets havedisappeared. How can this be?There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.JEDI CHILD JACKBecause someone erased it from thearchive memory.CHILDRENThat s right! Yes! That s whathappened! Someone erased it!JEDI CHILD MAYIf the planet blew up, the gravitywould go away.OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.YODATruly wonderful, the mind of achild is. Uncluttered.

PADME looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her silently.PADMEWhen I was in Level Three, we usedto come here for school retreat.See that island? We used to swimthere every day. I love the water.ANAKINI do too. I guess it comes fromgrowing up on a desert planet.PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.PADME...We used to lie on the sand andlet the sun dry us... and try toguess the names of the birdssinging.ANAKINI don t like sand. It s coarseand rough and irritating, and itgets everywhere. Not like here.Here everything s soft... andsmooth...He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.PADMEThere was a very old man who livedon the island. He used to makeglass out of sand - and vases andnecklaces out of the glass. Theywere magical.ANAKIN(looks into her eyes)Everything here is magical.PADMEYou could look into the glass andsee the water. The way it ripplesand moves. It looked so real...but it wasn t.ANAKINSometimes, when you believesomething to be real, it becomesreal. Real enough, anyway...They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin.PADMEI used to think if you looked toodeeply into glass, you wouldlose yourself.ANAKINI think it's true...ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away.PADMEI shouldn't have done that.ANAKINI'm sorry.

His eyes are on his plate.PADMEYou did that?ANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence.ANAKINWhat?PADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her.PADMEThat! Now stop it!PADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.PADME(continuing)Anakin!!ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.ANAKINI'm not really supposed to dothat... for fun, I mean.

You can'tdeny that.PADMEAnnie, it doesn't make anydifference. Jedi aren't allowedto marry. You swore an oath,remember? You'd be expelled fromthe Order. I will not let yougive up your responsibilities...your future, for me.ANAKINI was destined to be a Jedi. Idon't think I could be anythingelse. But you are asking me to berational.

They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. PADME is picking flowers.PADMEI don't know...ANAKINSure you do... you just don't wantto tell me.PADMEAre you going to use one of yourJedi mind tricks on me?ANAKINThey only work on the weak-minded.You are anything but weak-minded.PADMEAll right... his name was Palo.I was twelve. We were both in theLegislative Youth Program.

He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.ANAKINYou're always so serious. Alwayscarrying the weight of theuniverse on your shoulders.ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAYOBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground.

His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness.OBI-WAN listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it.He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.A SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING. It plummets to its death hundreds of feet below.EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) - NIGHTANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS outside it.EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) - NIGHTANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the wall,s overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to him him until he arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall.INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHTThe lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut.He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.ANAKINMom... Mom... Mom... SHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood.SHMIAnnie...? Is it you?SHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp.ANAKINI m here, Mom. You re safe. Hangon. I m going to get you out ofhere...SHMII m so glad... to see you,Annie... Now... I am complete...ANAKINJust stay with me, Mom. I m goingto make you well again.Everything s going to be fine.SHMIYou look so handsome. My son...my grown-up son. I m so proud ofyou, Annie... so proud... I missedyou so much... I love...SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms.EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHTOBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWNThe pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakin s lightsaber switches on.EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHTOBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit.

GUARDS extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other.The DRIVER gets up onto his seat.ANAKINDon't be afraid.PADMEI'm not afraid to die. I've beendying a little bit each day sinceyou came back into my life.ANAKINWhat are you talking about?PADMEI love you.ANAKINYou love me?! I thought wedecided not to fall in love.

They kiss.ANAKINI have no desire to be cured ofthis love either. Long or short,I vow to spend the rest of my lifewith you.They kiss again.The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arenaINT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAYThe great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS.

PADME is in the center.OBI-WANI was beginning to wonder if youhad gotten my message.ANAKINI retransmitted it as yourequested, Master. Then we decidedto come and rescue you.OBI-WANIt looks like you're going a goodjob so far.Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take their places.SUN RITThe felons before you have beenconvicted of espionage against theSovereign System of Geonosis.Their sentence of death is to becarried out in this public arenahenceforth.The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.POGGLELet the executions begin!The crowd goes wild.ANAKINI have a bad feeling about this.From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.OBI-WANTake the one the left. I'lltake the one on the right.ANAKINWhat about Padme?PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.OBI-WANIt looks like she's already on topof things.The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the postOBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.The NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.In the archducal box:NUTE GUNRAYFoul!! She can't do that... shoother or something!In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.ANAKINYou okay?PADME(nods, gasping)Sure! Well, sort of.ANAKINJump!!!The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.NUTE GUNRAYThis isn't how it's supposed tobe! Jango, finish her off.COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.COUNT DOOKU(smiling enigmatically)Patiece, Viceroy... she will die.Maybe this is the way it'ssupposed to end.OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAYARTOO BEEPSC-3POYes, it has been rather a longtime.

THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS.

Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.PLO KOONWe've done it! Now we have achance!Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND.

He picks it up.KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.COUNT DOOKUMaster Windu!Silence.COUNT DOOKU(continuing)You have fought gallantly. Worthyof recognition in the historyarchives of the Jedi Order. Nowit is finished.(pauses briefly)Surrender - and your lives will be spared.MACE WINDUWe will not be hostages for you tobarter with Dooku.COUNT DOOKUThen, I'm sorry, old friend.

PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.PADMELook!Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.YODACome on - hurry! Hurry!The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.EXT.

BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE - DAYGunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids.INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAYOBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.OBI-WANHold on! Look over there...Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.ANAKINIt's Dooku, go after him!The PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.ANAKIN(continuing)Padme!!!ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.ANAKIN(continuing; to pilot)Put the ship down! Down!OBI-WANNo! Forget her. We have to goafter Dooku.ANAKINNo we're not!! Land this ship!OBI-WANDon't let your personal feelingsget in the way. We've got a job todo.Below, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU.ANAKINI don't care!.. Go back.OBI-WANAnakin! She's all right! Look.ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS.OBI-WAN(continuing)Follow that speeder!On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAYCOUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.DROID CAPTAINYour Excellency!COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.COUNT DOOKUThat won't be necessary, Captain.Stand down. And leave them to me.The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.OBI-WAN(to Anakin)We move in together - you slowlyon the...ANAKINI'm taking him now!OBI-WANAnakin, no!ANAKINYou'll pay for all the Jedi you'vekilled today, Dooku.ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WANCOUNT DOOKUKenobi, isn't it? As you can see,my Jedi powers are far beyondyours. Now, back down.OBI-WANI don't think so.OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.COUNT DOOKUAh, but if I must.COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.COUNT DOOKU(continuing)I have spent the last ten yearslearning to use the power of theDark Side. It gives me infinitelygreater power.OBI-WANYou will have to prove it.OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.COUNT DOOKUGrand Master Kenobi, youdisappoint me. Yoda holds you insuch high esteem.COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.COUNT DOOKU(continuing)Surely you can do better...?(parries)No, I'm surprised. Has Jediswordsmanship degenerated soquickly, or are you trying to makefun of me?(cuts)Which is it?COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.COUNT DOOKU(continuing)come, come, Master Kenobi. Put meout of my misery.OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.COUNT DOOKU(continuing)That's brave of you, boy - butfoolish. I would have thoughtyou'd have learnt your lesson.ANAKINI'm a slow learner.And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.COUNT DOOKUYou have unusual powers, youngPadawan. But not enought to saveyou this time.ANAKINDon't bet on it!OBI-WANAnakin!OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.COUNT DOOKUMaster Yoda. At last we shallknow who is the most powerful.YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.YODACount Dooku. No interest incontests, do I have.COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.YODA(continuing)The end for you, Count, this is.COUNT DOOKU...Not yet...COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADME and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.PADMEAnakin!PADME runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.CLONE CAPTAINResistance is at an end, General.What are your orders ?YODA looks at him and sighs.EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWNCOUNT DOOKU'S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU manoeuvres the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands.INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAWNThe ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting.

Victory, you say?OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the Chamber is empty.YODA(continuing)Not victory, a defeat, it was...Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the CloneWar has!EXT.

Everyone watches comberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.The Great Clone War has begun...FADE OUT:THE END  Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.5 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACEOBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.OBI-WAN: We've got to split them up.ANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.OBI-WAN: Easy for you to say . . .  the bait?ANAKIN: Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.OBI-WAN: Anakin, they're all over me!ANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . .ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES.ANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo!ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning.ANAKIN: I copy, Artoo.OBI-WAN: I'm going down on the deck.ANAKIN: Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN.ANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.OBI-WAN: Hurry up! I don't like this!OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan's Astro Droid, ARFOUR.OBI-WAN: (continuing) Ouch!R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.OBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.ANAKIN: We're locked on ... we've got him . . .ANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight.ANAKIN: (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.OBI-WAN: Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.ANAKIN: Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead.ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit.ANAKIN: (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids.6 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACEOBI-WAN: I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.Ahead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configuration, lift off the CRUISER, and attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS.ANAKIN: Come on, Master.OBI-WAN: Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?ODD BALL: (OS) Copy, Red Leader.OBI-WAN: Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .7 INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACEODD BALL: We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI-FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings.8 INT. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACEANAKIN: This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.ARTOO BEEPS a worried message.OBI-WAN: Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .ANAKIN: I'm going head to head. See you.OBI-WAN: Take it easy, Anakin.Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.ODD BALL: I'm on your right, Red Leader.ANAKIN: Incoming!!ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.OBI-WAN: Five more on the right!Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS.ANAKIN: Here we go.The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.OBI-WAN: I'm going high and right.ANAKIN: Hang on. There are four more of them.OBI-WAN: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.ANAKIN: I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.OBI-WAN: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.In one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.ARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.ANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good.OBI-WAN: Anakin, you have four on your tail.ANAKIN: I know. I know!OBI-WAN: Four more closing from your left.ANAKIN: I know. I know!OBI-WAN: Break right and go high.ANAKIN: I'm going low and left.Obi-Wan shakes his head.OBI-WAN: (to himself) He still has much to learn.ANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.ANAKIN: Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .OBI-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: "Survive."ANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.OBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.OBI-WAN: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.OBI-WAN: (continuing) You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.ARTOO BEEPS nervously.ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.OBI-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."ANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo.ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.ANAKIN: (continuing) I'm through.OBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION.A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space.Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.ODD BALL: There are too many of them.CLONE PILOT 2: I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .ANAKIN: I'm going to go help them out!OBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.ANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up!ANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.OBI-WAN: They overshot us . . .The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wans Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them.ANAKIN: They're coming around!OBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.ANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.ANAKIN: We got 'em. Artoo!Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.OBI-WAN: Flying is for droids.Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders.OBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin?ANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids.The BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR.OBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .ARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away.OBI-WAN: Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.ANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.OBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.ANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wans Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship.OBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ...ANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . .OBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.ANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .OBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.ANAKIN: Move to the right.OBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.ANAKIN: I'm not leaving without you, Master.ANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN's and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view.ANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID.OBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.ANAKIN: Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!OBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.ANAKIN: Yeah, you got him!OBI-WAN: Great, Artoo.ANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.OBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up?ANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master.ANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN's disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.OBI-WAN: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERThe shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.ANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut.OBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions.ANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN.OBI-WAN: Artoo, locate the Chancellor.ANAKIN: Tap into the ship's computers.They cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears.OBI-WAN: The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.ANAKIN: I sense Count Dooku . . .OBI-WAN: I sense a trap.ANAKIN: Next move?OBI-WAN: Spring the trap.The JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO.ANAKIN: Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.OBI-WAN: Here, take this, and wait for orders.OBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO.10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERGENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: What's the situation, Captain?CAPTAIN: TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Just as Count Dooku predicted.11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.BODYGUARD I: General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.OBI-WAN: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.As a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back.OBI-WAN: Anakin. . .ANAKIN: Ready.ANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor.12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERThe TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.OBI-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.ANAKIN: Well then, we're safe for the time being.OBI-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.They run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers.ANAKIN: They're sealing this section off.OBI-WAN: Six droids coming our way!The last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.ANAKIN: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.They move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.OBI-WAN: We'll never get through that. It's too small!They move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.The fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.ANAKIN: I found our escape vent.OBI-WAN: Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.ANAKIN: Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .ANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a "man-sized" work shaft. They scramble through it as the DROIDS swim closer.13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERThe TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube.ANAKIN: Here's a way out.As the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERThe TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end.15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERA hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser sword.OBI-WAN: That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.ANAKIN: The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.OBI-WAN: You still have much to learn, Anakin.16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERThe SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger.SUPER BATTLE DROID R77: I have a bad feeling about this.17 INT.

I have much to learn. Let's go!ANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway.20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERThe two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more times.ANAKIN: Destroyers!!Finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE DROIDS standing behind them.BATTLE DROID: Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em.The JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE DROIDS.21 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERR2-D2 notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar.

ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISEROBI-WAN: Artoo?ANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator.OBI-WAN: (continuing) Always on the move.OBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply.25 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS try to figure out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface.OBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.26 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERSuddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. ANAKIN struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as SPARKING wires rain down on him.27 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERThe elevator starts to descend rapidly.OBI-WAN: Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.28 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERAnakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. The door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and TWO BATTLE DROIDS appear in the doorway and look down at ANAKIN. They point their guns at him.DROID 1: Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.DROID 2: Roger, roger.29 INT.

ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. He looks at the BATTLE DROIDS leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft.Before ANAKIN can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the DROIDS in two. ANAKIN lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling. OBI-WAN is startled and ignites his lightsaber.OBI-WAN: Oh, it's you . . .35 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip on the oil.36 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERANAKIN: What was that all about?OBI-WAN: Well, Artoo has been . . .ANAKIN: No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.OBI-WAN: Did I say anything?ANAKIN: He's trying!OBI-WAN: I didn't say anything!37 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. ARTOO rolls away.38 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTER'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERThe elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room of the General's Quarters.At the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR.As they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor's face.OBI-WAN: (bows) Chancellor.ANAKIN: Are you all right?PALPATINE: (quietly) Count Dooku.PALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.OBI-WAN: (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.ANAKIN: I was about to say that.COUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level.PALPATINE: Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.OBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.OBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.COUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.OBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU.OBI-WAN: You won't get away this time, Dooku.OBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues.COUNT DOOKU: I've been looking forward to this.ANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.COUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.DOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . .COUNT DOOKU: (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better.As the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force.ANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking.ANAKIN hits the archway.DOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight.COUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you dont use them.Anakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense.Anakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness.39 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERAnakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU's defeat.PALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!ANAKIN: I shouldn't . . .PALPATINE: Do it!!ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.ANAKIN: ... I couldn't stop myself.PALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.ANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE.ANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.ANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose.ANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.PALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.PALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.The ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators.PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.ANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.PALPATINE: Leave him, or we'll never make it.ANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours.ANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators.40 INT.

Activate Elevator 3224.Suddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft.ANAKIN: (continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!43 INT.

ARTOO starts to slide toward one of the small holes.45 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERAs the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway.ANAKIN clings to the doorframe with OBI-WAN on his shoulder, as the Chancellor struggles to join him.46 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the BATTLE DROIDS stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. ARTOO BEEPS a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the BATTLE DROIDS. One bolt hits very near him, and he SCREAMS in terror.47 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERPILOT: Magnetize! Magnetize!48 INT.

Come on, we have to be fast.PALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other.51 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERGENERAL GRIEVOUS: Fire the emergency booster engines.PILOT: Leveling out, sir.52 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT ON SIDE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERANAKIN still carrying OBI-WAN on his back, and PALPATINE run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi's leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft.53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains consciousness and tries to look around.ANAKIN: Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.OBI-WAN: Did I miss something?OBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan's comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them.ANAKINN: Hold on.OBI-WAN: What is that?OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN.OBI-WAN: (continuing) Oops.ANAKIN: Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!OBI-WAN: Too late! Jump!They fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal.ANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.54 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door and land.OBI-WAN: Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on.ANAKIN: Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?55 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERAs the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO SQUEALS and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken BATTLE DROID PARTS. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris.56 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISEROBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the hangar bay.57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISERIt is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.OBI-WAN: None of those ships will get us anywhere.ANAKIN: I agree.PALPATINE: What are we going to do?ANAKIN: I don't know.OBI-WAN: Don't look at me. I don't know.ANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin's Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side.ANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.OBI-WAN: We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.ANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISEROBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISEROBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath.ANAKIN/OBI-WAN: Well, that was close.They laugh.60 INT.

Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway.ANAKIN: Ray shields!OBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.OBI-WAN: Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.ANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.OBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.ANAKIN: You're the Master. I'm just a hero.OBI-WAN: I'm open to suggestions here.PALPATINE: Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.The Jedi look at each other in disbelief.ANAKIN: I say . . . patience.OBI-WAN: Patience! That's your plan, is it?ANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.ANAKIN: (continuing) See! No problem.Suddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS.ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO over.SUPER BATTLE DROID: Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.OBI-WAN: Do you have a plan B?62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISEROBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.A BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI'S lightsabers.OBI-WAN: That depends upon your point of view. Hah!GENERAL GRIEVOUS: And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.ANAKIN: General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .OBI-WAN: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.OBI-WAN: Not this time. And this time you won't escape.ANAKIN: Artoo.ARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around.OBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Crush them! Make them suffer!ANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General's hand.The DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS's TWO BODYGUARDS.CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay and watch your stations.OBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous's BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge.OBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID BODYGUARD'S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away.ANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor.OBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces.ALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS.PILOT: Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.OBI-WAN and ANAKIN destroy the remaining DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS retrieves one of the BODYGUARD'S staffs and faces OBI-WAN. ANAKIN leaps over a console and lands behind GENERAL GRIEVOUS.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You lose, General Kenobi.One of the PILOTS stands next to the General.PILOT: The ship is breaking up!GENERAL GRIEVOUS: We've run out of time.OBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the General from the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship.OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes around where the window used to be.63 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISEROBI-WAN continues to fight the BATTLE DROIDS. The DROIDS have backed him into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control panel as the DROIDS blast away at him. He jumps up and over the DROIDS, cutting most of them down before he lands. He destroys the DROIDS and joins ANAKIN.ANAKIN and OBI-WAN cut through the rest of the DROIDS as if they were made of butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he watches the carnage. Droid parts are firing everywhere. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stand back to back and cut down the last of the DROIDS just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. SPARKS begin to fly outside the windows.PALPATINE: The hull is burning up!64 EXT.

BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISEROBI-WAN and ANAKIN go over to the navigator's chair.ANAKIN: All the escape pods have been launched.OBI-WAN: Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?ANAKIN: You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?ANAKIN sits in the pilot's chair and sees on a screen the back half of the ship break away. There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward.OBI-WAN: Well?ANAKIN: Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.OBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to glow, and pieces break off. ARTOO moves in on Palpatine 's controls and assists in flying the cruiser.OBI-WAN: Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.ARTOO beeps.ANAKIN: Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.OBI-WAN: Temp steady.

Landing strip's straight ahead.ANAKIN: We're coming in too hot.OBI-WAN: Easy-easy.The ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the Coruscant skyline. PALPATINE and OBI-WAN hold on for dear life as the ship shakes and rattles toward an industrial landing platform.68 EXT. CORUSCANT-INDUSTRIAL LANDING PLATFORM-AFTERNOONA large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard landing.OBI-WAN: Another happy landing.69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOONThe small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-3PO, waiting for them. PALPATINE, R2-D2, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle.ANAKIN: (to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master?OBI-WAN: Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.ANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.OBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .ANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.OBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.ANAKIN: All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .OBI-WAN: Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.ANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN.The CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE.MACE WlNDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?PALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.MACE WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.PALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.MACE WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.BAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway.BAIL ORGANA: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.ANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway.ANAKIN: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.ARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd.C-3PO: It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.ARTOO beeps.C-3PO: (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOONANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them.BAIL ORGANA: The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.ANAKIN: I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.Behind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure.BAIL ORGANA: I'll do everything I can with the Senate.ANAKIN: Excuse me.BAIL ORGANA: Certainly.ANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.PADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.ANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.PADME: There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.ANAKIN: I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.ANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.PADME: Wait, not here . . .He grabs her again.ANAKIN: Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.PADME: Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .ANAKIN: I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.PADME: (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.ANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her.ANAKIN: Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?PADME: I'm just excited to see you.ANAKIN: That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?PADME: Nothing . . . nothing . . .ANAKIN: You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on!PADME begins to cry.PADME: You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .ANAKIN: . . . Is there someone else?PADME: (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.ANAKIN: (sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.PADME: I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.ANAKIN: It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .PADME: Something wonderful has happened.They look at each other for a long moment.PADME: (continuing) I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.ANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this. He takes her in his arms.ANAKIN: That's . . . that's wonderful.PADME: What are we going to do?ANAKIN: We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.71 EXT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAYA small NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE lands. BATTLE DROIDS surround the ramp as GENERAL GRIEVOUS descends onto the platform. SUPER BATTLE DROID G21 approaches.SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Good. Where is the Separatist Council?SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: This way, sir ...GENERAL GRIEVOUS takes the elevator to an upper level. He enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on the table, and bows.72 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAYA hologram of Darth Sidious appears.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Yes, Lord Sidious.DARTH SlDIOUS: General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: It will be done, My Lord.DARTH SlDIOUS: The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.The hologram of Sidious talks to GRIEVOUS about the death of Count Dooku.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: But the loss of Count Dooku?DARTH SlDIOUS: His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.73 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHTPADME stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans against the wall, watching her lovingly.ANAKIN: . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.PADME: Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.ANAKIN: You are so beautiful!PADME: It's only because I'm so in love . . .ANAKIN: No, it's because I'm so in love with you.PADME: So love has blinded you?ANAKIN: Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .PADME: But it's probably true!They laugh.ANAKIN: I haven't laughed in so long . . .PADME: Neither have I.74 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAMThe view is strangely distorted and disorienting. PADME is on a table in an alien medical chamber. She is giving birth and is screaming.PADME: Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.She screams and dies.75 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-BEDROOM-NIGHTANAKIN awakens in a panic. He is covered in sweat. He looks over in the bed and sees PADME sound asleep next to him. ANAKIN gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. He is breathing heavily. He puts his head in his hands and weeps. He regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone.PADME: Anakin??She gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.76 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHTANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. The vast city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out before him. He is distraught.PADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn't look at her.PADME: What's bothering you?ANAKIN: Nothing . . .ANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME'S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy.ANAKIN: (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.PADME: Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?ANAKIN: It was a dream.PADME: Bad?ANAKIN: Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.PADME: And?ANAKIN: It was about you.They look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them.PADME: Tell me.ANAKIN: It was only a dream.PADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath.ANAKIN: (continuing) You die in childbirth . . .PADME: And the baby?ANAKIN: I don't know.PADME: It was only a dream.ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.ANAKIN: . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.They embrace, then part.PADME: Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.ANAKIN: I know .PADME: Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?ANAKIN: (suspicious) Have you told him anything?PADME: No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.ANAKIN: He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!PADME: I won't, Anakin.ANAKIN: I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAYYODA and ANAKIN sit in Yoda 's room, deep in thought.YODA: Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .ANAKIN: They are of pain, suffering, death . . .YODA: Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?ANAKIN: Someone . . .YODA: . . . close to you?ANAKIN: Yes.YODA: Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.ANAKIN: I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.YODA: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.ANAKIN: What must I do, Master Yoda?YODA: Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.78 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAYANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi Briefing Room. SEVERAL JEDI are exiting.79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAYANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches the Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. Only OBI-WAN remains at the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps.OBI-WAN: You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.ANAKIN: I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.OBI-WAN: In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.ANAKIN: What's wrong then?OBI-WAN: The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.ANAKIN: Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.OBI-WAN: Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.ANAKIN: Be careful of what?OBI-WAN: He has requested your presence.ANAKIN: What for?OBI-WAN: He would not say.ANAKIN: He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?OBI-WAN: All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.ANAKIN: I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?OBI-WAN: The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAYANAKIN stands with PALPATINE at his window overlooking the vastness of Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed. A brown haze hangs over the landscape.PALPATINE: Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.ANAKIN: The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?PALPATINE: They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.ANAKIN: I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.PALPATINE: There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.ANAKIN: With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.PALPATINE: Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.ANAKIN: Everyone will agree on that.PALPATINE: Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.ANAKIN: Of course.PALPATINE: I need your help, son.ANAKIN: What do you mean?PALPATINE: I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.ANAKIN: I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.PALPATINE: Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.ANAKIN: For what? I don't understand.PALPATINE: To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .ANAKIN thinks about this.PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.ANAKIN: Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.PALPATINE: I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.81 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S OFFICE-DAYPADME, BAIL ORGANA, and SENATORS MON MOTHMA, FANG ZAR, TERR TANEEL, and GIDDEAN DANU sit in Senator Organa 's office.BAIL ORGANA: Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.FANG ZAR: When did this happen?BAIL ORGANA: The decree was posted this morning.PADME: Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?MON MOTHMA: Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.GIDDEAN DANU: The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.BAIL ORGANA: We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.EVERYONE looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of what was just said.TERR TANEEL: What are you suggesting?BAIL ORGANA: I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.MON MOTHMA: We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.BAIL ORGANA: It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.PADME: I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.GlDDEAN DANU: Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.MON MOTHMA: The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.BAIL ORGANA: We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .PADME: Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid.BAIL ORGANA: Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.MON MOTHMA: That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.They ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment.PADME: Agreed.82 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAYANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers. The door opens.83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAYANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is surrounded by the Jedi Council MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI-WAN, YODA, the HOLOGRAMS of PLO KOON and KI-ADI-MUNDI.MACE: Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.ANAKIN: I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.YODA: Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.ANAKIN: I understand.MACE: You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.Anakin reacts with anger.ANAKIN: What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?MACE: Take a seat, young Skywalker.ANAKIN: Forgive me, Master.ANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks.Kl-ADI-MUNDI: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.YODA: Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.OBI-WAN: It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.MACE: We cannot take ships from the front line.OBI-WAN: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.YODA: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.Kl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?MACE: It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!OBI-WAN: He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.ANAKIN: I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.MACE: Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.YODA: Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.MACE: It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.ANAKIN is disappointed.84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOONANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN is furious.ANAKIN: What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!OBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.ANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .OBI-WAN: But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.ANAKIN: That has nothing to do with this.OBI-WAN: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.ANAKIN: You mean divided loyalties.OBI-WAN: I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.ANAKIN: The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.OBI-WAN: No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.ANAKIN: Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.OBI-WAN: I hope so . . .ANAKIN: I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.OBI-WAN: Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.ANAKIN: And?OBI-WAN: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.ANAKIN: What situation?OBI-WAN: (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.ANAKIN: They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!OBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.ANAKIN: Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?OBI-WAN: This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.ANAKIN: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.OBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.ANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.OBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.ANAKIN: You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?OBI-WAN: The Council is asking you.85 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAYA JEDI GUNSHIP heads for the huge Clone landing platform.86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAYYODA, MACE, and OBI-WAN ride in the GUNSHIP as it heads for the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting.OBI-WAN : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.YODA: Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.MACE: It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.OBI-WAN: He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.MACE:I wish I did.OBI-WAN: With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?MACE: So the prophecy says.YODA: A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.OBI-WAN: He will not let me down. He never has.YODA: I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.The GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then take off in the GUNSHIP.87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSETPadme's Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN TYPHO escorts PADME onto the veranda, where TWO HANDMAIDENS (ELLE and MOTEE) are waiting. PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO.PADME: Thank you, Captain.CAPTAIN TYPHO: Rest well. My Lady.CAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby.PADME: I'll be up in a while.MOTEE: Yes, my lady.C-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit.C-3PO: Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?PADME: Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.The golden droid turns and exits.PADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward her. She senses something.ANAKIN: Beautiful, isn't it?PADME jumps and turns around.PADME: You startled me.He sits next to her on the bench.ANAKIN: How are you feeling?PADME: He keeps kicking.ANAKIN: He?! Why do you think it's a boy?PADME: (laughs) My motherly intuition.She puts his hand on her belly.ANAKIN: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.They laugh.PADME: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.ANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.PADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.ANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.PADME: Anakin . . .ANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.PADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?ANAKIN: (suspicious) What do you mean?PADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?ANAKIN: I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!PADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.ANAKIN: (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!PADME: What is it?ANAKIN: Nothing.PADME: Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.ANAKIN: You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.They look in each other's eyes.ANAKIN: (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.PADME is startled at this.PADME: I sense there are things you are not telling me.PADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed.PADME: (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHTANAKIN lands his speeder and exits.ANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House.ANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine's box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing "Squid Lake."ANAKIN: You wanted to see me, Chancellor.PALPATINE: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.ANAKIN: At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.PALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far  but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.ANAKIN: They try.PALPATINE: Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us.ANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him.PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.ANAKIN: I'm not sure I understand.PALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.ANAKIN: I don't think . . .PALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?ANAKIN: I know they don't trust you . . .PALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.ANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.PALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?ANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down.PALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?ANAKIN: I don't know ... I don't know what to say.PALPATINE: Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.ANAKIN: The Jedi use their power for good.PALPATINE: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .ANAKIN: . . . evil.PALPATINE: . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.ANAKIN: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.PALPATINE: And the Jedi don't?ANAKIN: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.PALPATINE smiles.PALPATINE: Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?ANAKIN: I'm not sure it's wrong.PALPATINE: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.ANAKIN is deep in thought.PALPATINE: (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?ANAKIN: No.PALPATINE: I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.ANAKIN: He could actually save people from death?PALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.ANAKIN: What happened to him?PALPATINE: He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.ANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power?PALPATINE: Not from a Jedi.89 EXT.

The discussion includes OBI-WAN, MACE, AGEN KOLAR, YODA- KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON.Kl-ADI-MUNDI: (holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.MACE: (holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.ANAKIN: A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.YODA: Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.OBI-WAN: Does everyone agree?All the JEDI concur.ANAKIN: The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.They all look at ANAKIN a bit disturbed.MACE: (a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.Kl-ADI-MUNDI: Yes, this decision is ours to make.ANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.YODA: A Master is needed, with more experience.MACE: Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.ANAKIN: He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.OBI-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.ANAKIN: (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.OBI-WAN: Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.YODA: Obi-Wan, my choice is.Kl-ADI-MUNDI: I concur. Master Kenobi should go.YODA: I agree.All the JEDI concur.MACE: Very well. Council is adjourned.ANAKIN is angry.MACE: (continuing) Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.91 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAYYODA gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the platform.CLONE COMMANDER GREE: The droids have started up their main power generators.YODA: Then now the time is, Commander.CLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, sir.The battle begins.92 EXT. KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAYA WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN lets out a roar as the Wookiee army rushes to face the DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS race across the water against the WOOKIEES and CLONE TROOPERS on the beach. DROID GUNSHIPS provide air support, while a SPIDER DROID emerges from the watery depths. A brave WOOKIEE places an explosive on a SEPARATIST TANK and jumps off just before the TANK EXPLODES. From the Hologram Area, Yoda observes the ongoing battle.93 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNINGPadme's apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city of Coruscant.94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNINGPADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches.OBI-WAN: Has Anakin been to see you?PADME: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.OBI-WAN: I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.They laugh.PADME: You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?OBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme.PADME: You're not very good at hiding your feelings.OBI-WAN: It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.PADME: Why would he talk to me about his work?OBI-WAN studies her.OBI-WAN: Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.PADME: Don't give me that look.OBI-WAN: I know how he feels about you.PADME: (nervous) What did he say?OBI-WAN: Nothing. He didn't have to.PADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony.PADME: I don't know what you're talking about.OBI-WAN: I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him.PADME looks down and doesn't answer.OBI-WAN: (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .They stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI-WAN starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city.OBI-WAN: (continuing) Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .PADME: Thank you, Obi-Wan.OBI-WAN: Please do what you can to help him.95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-DAYPADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in Padme's living room. C-3PO serves drinks to the guests.PADME: We cannot let this turn into another war.BAIL ORGANA: Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.MON MOTHMA: We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.PADME: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.BANA BREEMU: That would be dangerous.MON MOTHMA: We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.PADME: I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.GiDDEAN DANU: Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.PADME: The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .CHI EEKWAY: Patience, Senator.FANG ZAR: We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.BANA BREEMU: When you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the Chancellor, things may change.BAIL ORGANA: Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.PADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment.96 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAYANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk onto a landing platform overlooking a docking bay where THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS and armored weapons, tanks, etc., are being loaded onto a massive REPUBLIC ASSAULT SHIP.ANAKIN: You're going to need me on this one, Master.OBI-WAN: Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.OBI-WAN starts to turn and leave.ANAKIN: Master!OBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him.ANAKIN: (continuing) Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.OBI-WAN: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.OBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back.OBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.ANAKIN: Well, there's always a first time.OBI-WAN laughs.They talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN depart.ANAKIN: Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.OBI-WAN: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.OBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic cruiser.97 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAYThe Republic cruiser lifts off and heads for space.98 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACECLONE TROOPERS stand at attention in rows on the floor of the hangar deck, waiting to board landing craft. OBI-WAN stands next to his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER- talking to SEVERAL CLONE COMMANDERS with their helmets off. A hologram of the planet Utapau is projected by R4-G9 into the middle of the hangar.CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.OBI-WAN: I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?They laugh.OBI-WAN: (laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.OBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter.CLONE COMMANDER CODY: That was Anakin who was late. I believe.OBI-WAN: Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.CLONE COMMANDER CODY: I'm counting on you.99 EXT. JEDI FIGHTER-SPACEOBI-WAN blasts the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER out of the Republic Battle Cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. He heads for the planet Utapau.100 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR'S TRANSPORT-DAYThe Chancellor's Transport races through the city and heads for the Senate Office Building landing platform. Waiting on the landing platform is a LONE JEDI. The Transport lands, and CHANCELLOR PALPATINE emerges with FOUR ROYAL GUARDS and MAS AMEDDA. The FOUR ROYAL GUARDS move off in another direction as PALPATINE greets ANAKIN, who has been waiting for him.PALPATINE: Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?ANAKIN: He will soon have Grievous's head.PALPATINE: We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.ANAKIN: The Council was very sure in its decision.They exit the landing platform.101 INT.

Good en to see yousa . . .The Gungan waves to Anakin.ANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar.JAR JAR: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.Anakin turns back to the Chancellor.PALPATINE: There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.ANAKIN: Not fit? Why would anyone think that?PALPATINE: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.ANAKIN: That's ridiculous. Who?!?PALPATINE: (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.ANAKIN: That's impossible. I would know.PALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.ANAKIN becomes worried.PALPATINE: (continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAMPADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly speaks to her.OBI-WAN: Save your energy.PADME: I can't!OBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme. Don't give up . . .103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAYANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch where Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind him.ANAKIN: I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?PADME: He came by this morning.ANAKIN: What did he want?PADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense.PADME: He's worried about you.ANAKIN: You told him about us, didn't you?She continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.PADME: He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.ANAKIN: And he's not?PADME: You have been moody lately.ANAKIN: I'm not moody . . .PADME: Anakin! Don't do this again.ANAKIN: I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.PADME: Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.ANAKIN: Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.PADME: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.ANAKIN: Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.PADME: You expect too much of yourself.They stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly.ANAKIN: I have found a way to save you.PADME: Save me?ANAKIN: From my nightmares.PADME: Is that what's bothering you?ANAKIN: I won't lose you, Padme.PADME: I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.ANAKIN: No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.PADME looks ANAKIN in the eye.PADME: You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.They embrace and kiss.104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACEOBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER's hyperspace ring and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the planet's surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes.105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAYOBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON, comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the landing platform, GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN talks to TION MEDON.TlON MEDON: Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?OBI-WAN: Unfortunately, the war.TlON MEDON: There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.OBI-WAN: With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.A GROUND CREW rushes out and refuels Obi-Wans Fighter. TION MEDON leans close to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly.TlON MEDON: He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.OBI-WAN: I understand.TlON MEDON: The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .OBI-WAN: Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.OBI-WAN starts back toward his Starfighter as TION MEDON leaves the Landing Platform. GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS retreat from the overhead platform. OBI-WAN climbs back into his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER. His Astro Unit (R4-G9) turns to him:OBI-WAN: (continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact.The little Astro Droid BEEPS a reply.106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAYOn a high balcony, TION MEDON looks down on the landing platform. A few steps behind him stands one of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS. They watch the canopy lower.TlON MEDON: I told you, all he wanted was fuel.BODYGUARD: What was his name?TlON MEDON: He didn't say.They watch as the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER takes off.107 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAYOBI-WAN also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city.108 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAYOBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the sinkhole. It's hard to see him. In an alcove, he carefully surveys the city, then quickly moves on.109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAYOBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates.He comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around.OBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his slight hand movements.OBI-WAN: I need transportation.WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation.OBI-WAN: Get it for me.WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.One of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.OBI-WAN: This one.The WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.WRANGLER: Boga. She answers to Boga.OBI-WAN: Good girl, Boga.OBI-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up and scurries outside to the edge of the sinkhole.110 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAYThe LIZARD BOGA rears up on her hind legs again, then climbs the wall of the sheer cliff and starts moving up toward the tenth level. The city appears to be deserted. OBI-WAN is alert to any movement.111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAYGENERAL GRIEVOUS stands before the COUNCIL OF SEPARATISTS, including NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO. POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT TAMBOR, and PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN hides above the assembly and watches intently.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.NUTE GUNRAY: Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.OBI-WAN is deep in thought.112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAYThe JEDI removes his cloak and jumps down behind the GENERAL.OBI-WAN: Hello, there!GENERAL GRIEVOUS: General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) Kill him!About a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.They stare at each other for a moment.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Enough of this.The BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi's lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury.OBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.OBI-WAN: Your move.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.His arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.OBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!OBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS's hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies.OBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.OBI-WAN: I don't think so.TWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him.113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAYMore CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS.The JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on.114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAYThe chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga.115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSETThe sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office Building. The sky is red.116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSETPALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE.PALPATINE: I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.PADME: May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?PALPATINE: I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .PADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.PALPATINE: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.FANGZAR: But surely . . .The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.PALPATINE: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.PADME: On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.PALPATINE: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.PADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.PALPATINE: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.ANAKIN: What do you mean?PALPATINE: They are not to be trusted.ANAKIN: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .PALPATINE: These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.ANAKIN: I'm sure you're mistaken.PALPATINE: I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.ANAKIN: I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.PALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look.PALPATINE: Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENINGKI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms.CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and wehave begun our attack.MACE WlNDU: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to hisintentions.ANAKIN: Yes, Master.ANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY's hologram disappears.MACE WINDU: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.Kl-ADI-MUNDI: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed fromoffice.MACE WiNDU: That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .Kl-ADI-MUNDI: . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.YODA: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENINGANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE.ANAKIN: Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.PALPATINE: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.ANAKIN: I should be there with him.PALPATINE: It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?ANAKIN: I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.PALPATINE: They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.They walk into the hallway.ANAKIN: How do you know the ways of the Force?PALPATINE: My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.They stop.ANAKIN: You know the dark side?!?PALPATINE: Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.ANAKIN: I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.PALPATINE: Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.ANAKIN: What did you say?PALPATINE: Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .ANAKIN: You're a Sith Lord!ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.PALPATINE: I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.ANAKIN: You're wrong!PALPATINE: Are you going to kill me?ANAKIN: I would certainly like to.PALPATINE: I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.ANAKIN raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE's throat. There is a tense moment, then ANAKIN relaxes, and then turns off his lightsaber.ANAKIN: I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.PALPATINE: Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?ANAKIN: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.PALPATINE: You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.ANAKIN stares at him for a moment.PALPATINE turns and moves to his office.PALPATINE: (continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .PALPATINE sits behind his desk.119 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAYOBI-WAN gives the LIZARD a swift kick with the heel of his boot, and they take off down the vertical side of the sheer cliff. As GENERAL GRIEVOUS reaches the landing platform where his shuttle is waiting. OBI-WAN drops onto the top of the starship with his LIZARD. GENERAL GRIEVOUS spins his scooter around and takes off up the vertical cliff face with OBI-WAN and his LIZARD in hot pursuit. The sinkhole is engulfed in a great battle between CLONES and DROIDS. The PEOPLE OF UTAPAU cower in whatever shelter they can find.120 EXT. UTAPAU-MAIN CITY PLAZA-DAYA LARGE GROUP OF UTAPAUAN TROOPS on LIZARDS attack the DROID ARMY.OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race through the city at breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides.GENERAL GRIEVOUS lays the Scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. Obi-Wan's LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep up. They destroy droids, equipment, and clone troops as the JEDI and the GENERAL cut a swath of destruction through the city.121 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAYGENERAL GRIEVOUS works his way out onto the rim of the sinkhole, passing some wind blades. The evil Droid General releases the brakes on the lethal blades, and they begin to spin, cutting off Obi-Wan's access to the General. Obi-Wan's LIZARD pulls up short in front of the blades. GENERAL GRIEVOUS laughs and talks into a comlink.GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.OBI-WAN sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.The GENERAL accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops, and clings to another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan's LIZARD attempts to jump to follow and barely makes it, almost falling into the precipice below.122 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAYGENERAL GRIEVOUS roars through the stone block tunnel system, riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes oncoming traffic. OBI-WAN races after the Droid, his LIZARD moving onto the ceiling as they pass traffic. OBI-WAN catches up with GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and they charge through the tunnel, side by side. OBI-WAN grabs the Droid's electronic staff.123 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAYExtending from the wall of a small sinkhole is a secret landing platform with a small Federation Fighter sitting in the middle of it. OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race out of the tunnel system and onto the landing platform.OBI-WAN yanks on the staff, then jumps off his LIZARD onto the General's scooter, knocking both warriors to the ground. GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls out a laser pistol and fires at OBI-WAN. The Jedi reaches out his hand, grabs the General's electro-staff and spins the staff, blocking the laser bolts.OBI-WAN charges GENERAL GRIEVOUS, swinging the staff and hitting the Droid in the stomach, knocking the gun away. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is hit by the staff, and the Force bends his forearm. He pulls OBI-WAN close to him, and they engage in a furious fight. The electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat. OBI-WAN struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal, unstoppable Droid.GENERAL GRIEVOUS's stomachplate is loose. OBI-WAN grabs it and rips it off, revealing the alien life form's guts encased in a bag in the Droid's chest.

Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.ANAKIN: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?PALPATINE: Their betrayal will be dealt with.

He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower.ANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.OBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin's DROID is faster. He catches up with his old Master.OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform.OBI-WAN: I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.ANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river.ANAKIN: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .OBI-WAN: From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.ANAKIN: From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.OBI-WAN: Well, then you are lost!ANAKIN: This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.ANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN's platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.OBI-WAN: It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.ANAKIN: You underestimate my power!OBI-WAN: Don't try it.ANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.ANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.OBI-WAN: (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.OBI-WAN picks up Anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.ANAKIN: I hate you!OBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.ANAKIN'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAYOBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can't watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.He runs back to Padme's ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.216 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAYOBI-WAN makes his way to the SKIFF. He looks for Padme. THREEPIO sticks his head out the door of the SKIFF.C-3PO: Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.OBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff.217 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAYPADME lies on a cot or bed inside the ship. OBI-WAN walks over and checks on her.PADME: Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?OBI-WAN looks at her sadly and does not answer. He brushes her hair back. Padme drops back into unconsciousness. ARTOO watches over her.OBI-WAN rides in the co-pilot's station. He sits looking pensive. THREEPIO drives.218 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAYANAKIN crawls up the bank, his body smoking. A shuttle flies overhead and lands.219 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-IMPERIAL SHUTTLE-DAYAn Imperial Shuttle closes its wings and settles on the highest of the Mustafar Landing Platforms.

MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO PIT-DAYDARTH SIDIOUS discovers what remains of ANAKIN and checks him out. He turns to the CLONES.DARTH SIDIOUS: Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.CLONE CAPTAIN: Yes sir. Right away.Several of the CLONES rush off as DARTH SIDlOUS puts his hand on ANAKIN's forehead.222 INT. POLIS MASSA-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHTOn the isolated asteroid of Polis Massa, YODA meditates.YODA: Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...QUI -GON: (V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.YODA: Eternal consciousness.QUI-GON: (V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.YODA: . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.QUI-GON: (V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.YODA: A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.YODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and breaks his meditation.BAIL ORGANA: Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.223 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAYThe CLONES have placed ANAKIN in a medical capsule. They float the wounded Sith Lord into the belly of the IMPERIAL CRUISER.

For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.OBI-WAN: She's dying?MEDICAL DROID: We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.BAIL ORGANA: Babies??!!MEDICAL DROID: She's carrying twins.YODA: Save them, we must. They are our last hope.The MEDICAL DROID rushes back to the operating room. ARTOO and THREEPIO watch, greatly puzzled. ARTOO BEEPS.C-3PO: It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.227 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAYANAKIN, in the medical capsule, is lifted onto a table in the Rehab Center. DROIDS go to work on him. ANAKIN has new legs and a new arm.228 INT.

She is holding Anakin's japor snippet.OBI-WAN: Save your energy.PADME: Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .A last gasp, and she dies. Obi-Wan studies the necklace.231 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAYDARTH SIDIOUS hovers around the periphery of a group of MEDICAL DROIDS who are working on ANAKIN. DARTH SIDIOUS paces in the foreground. A DROID approaches the Dark Lord.MEDICAL DROID: My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.DARTH SIDIOUS: Good. Good.The DROID moves back to the table where DARTH VADER lies. The table begins to move upright. DARTH SIDIOUS moves in next to DARTH VADER.DARTH SIDIOUS: (continuing) Lord Vader, can you hear me?DARTH VADER, with his dark mask and helmet, moves up into the frame until he is in a CLOSEUP.DARTH VADER: Yes, My Master.DARTH VADER looks around the room.DARTH VADER: (continuing) Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?DARTH SIDIOUS moves closer to the half droid/half man.DARTH SIDIOUS: I'm afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.A LOW GROAN emanates from Vader's mask. Suddenly everything in the room begins to implode, including some of the DROIDS.DARTH VADER: I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!VADER SCREAMS, breaks his bonds to the table, and steps forward, waving his hands, causing objects to fly around the room. SIDIOUS deflects the objects, but some of the DROIDS aren't so lucky. VADER'S PAINFUL SCREAMS echo throughout the Center.232 EXT. NABOO-ALDERAAN STARCRUISERBAIL ORGANA's Starcruiser approaches the city of Theed.233 INT.

In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.OBI-WAN: Training??YODA: An old friend has learned the path to immortality.OBI-WAN: Who?YODA: One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.OBI-WAN: Qui-Gon?

STAR WARS Episode IV A NEW HOPE From the JOURNAL OF THE WHILLS by George Lucas Revised Fourth Draft January 15, 1976 LUCASFILM LTD. A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away... A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls into infinity. It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy... The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2- D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco design. Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way. THREEPIO Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door. THREEPIO We're doomed! The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand. THREEPIO There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship. THREEPIO What's that? EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant Imperial starship. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke-filled corridor. In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces. An explosion hits near the robots. THREEPIO I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister... Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots. EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize-winning smile. A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the tiny robot to follow him. LUKE Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear! The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome. Artoo makes beeping sounds. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance. THREEPIO Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke- filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion. THREEPIO At last! Where have you been? Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance. THREEPIO They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway. Threepio chases after him. THREEPIO Wait a minute, where are you going? Artoo responds with electronic beeps. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord. IMPERIAL OFFICER The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles in vain. VADER Where are those transmissions you intercepted? Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat. VADER What have you done with those plans? REBEL OFFICER We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah... This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. VADER If this is a consular ship... were is the Ambassador? The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to his troops. VADER Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the troopers spots her. TROOPER There she is! Set for stun! Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body. TROOPER She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into the cramped four-man pod. THREEPIO Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Artoo beeps something to him. THREEPIO Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding the mission he is about to perform. THREEPIO Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps and twangs angrily. A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky robot jumps into the lifepod. THREEPIO I'm going to regret this. INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft. CHIEF PILOT There goes another one. CAPTAIN Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short- circuited. INT. LIFEPOD Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship. Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy. THREEPIO That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Artoo beeps an assuring response. THREEPIO Are you sure this things safe? EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as he flies past. WOMAN I've told you kids to slow down! INT. POWER STATION - DAY Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the office, yelling wildly. FIXER Did I hear a young noise blast through here? CAMIE It was just wormie on another rampage. Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the background. LUKE Shape it up you guys!... Biggs? Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug. LUKE I didn't know you were back! When did you get in? BIGGS Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working. (he laughs) LUKE The Academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission? Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony. BIGGS Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service... (he salutes) ...I just came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons. Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of it. LUKE I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look! DEAK Not again! Forget it. EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens. LUKE There they are! Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars Biggs sees two small silver specks. BIGGS That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there! Probably a freighter-tanker refueling. LUKE But there was a lot of firing earlier... Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the building in the process. Luke grabs them. LUKE Hey, easy with those... CAMIE Don't worry about it, Wormie. The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs his shoulders in resignation. FIXER I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system. Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing... Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about Luke's ineptitude. INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move. LEIA Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic... VADER Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. LEIA I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan... VADER You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor. Take her away! Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander turns to Vader. COMMANDER Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate. VADER I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base! COMMANDER She'll die before she tells you anything. VADER Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed! Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. They stop and snap to attention. SECOND OFFICER Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard. Vader turns to the Commander. VADER She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time. COMMANDER Yes, sir. EXT. SPACE The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the planet Tatooine. EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in the distance rests half buried in the sand. THREEPIO How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. Artoo answers with beeping sounds. THREEPIO I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds. THREEPIO What a desolate place this is. Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio stops and yells at him. THREEPIO Where are you going? A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small robot. THREEPIO Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. Artoo counters with a long whistle. THREEPIO What makes you think there are settlements over there? Artoo continues to make beeping sounds. THREEPIO Don't get technical with me. Artoo continues to make beeping sounds. THREEPIO What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the direction of the vast dune sea. THREEPIO And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges off in the direction of the towering mesas. THREEPIO No more adventures. I'm not going that way. Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant mountains. EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless miles. He looks back in the direction of the now distant rock mesas. THREEPIO That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving towards him. THREEPIO Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the approaching transport. THREEPIO Over here! Help! Please, help! EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer and the others can be heard working inside. LUKE (Very animated) ...so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail. I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He grounded me for the rest of the season. You should have been there... it was fantastic. BIGGS You ought to take it easy Luke. You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall. LUKE Look who's talking. Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city... BIGGS I've missed you kid. LUKE Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs. It's been so... quiet. Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke. BIGGS Luke, I didn't come back just to say good-bye... I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know. Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty. LUKE What are you talking about? BIGGS I made some friends at the Academy. (he whispers) ...when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance... Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless. LUKE Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How? BIGGS Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater! LUKE I'm sorry. I'm quiet. (he whispers) Listen how quiet I am. You can barely hear me... Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues. BIGGS My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact. LUKE You're crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them. BIGGS I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own... It's what we always talked about. Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side -- the side I believe in. LUKE And I'm stuck here... BIGGS I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You'll get your chance to get off this rock. LUKE Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead. BIGGS Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one blaster. LUKE I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now. BIGGS I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?... You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire. LUKE It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't bother with this rock. BIGGS Things always change. LUKE I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long? BIGGS No, I'm leaving in the morning... LUKE Then I guess I won't see you. BIGGS Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout. LUKE Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure... Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got. BIGGS So long, Luke. Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the power station. EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way. In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow path. The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the trail. EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank- like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked into the giant machine. The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport. INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end of the chamber. INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls out from the gloom. THREEPIO Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you! A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him. EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain ridge. EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half- buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. A trooper yells to an officer some distance away. FIRST TROOPER Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand and gives it to the first trooper. SECOND TROOPER Look, sir -- droids. EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune. INT. SANDCRAWLER Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off. THREEPIO Wake up! Wake up! Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men. Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the odd assortment of robots. THREEPIO We're doomed. A Jawa starts moving toward them. THREEPIO Do you think they'll melt us down? Artoo responds, making beeping sounds. THREEPIO Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house. The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be. Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language. A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard. BERU Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. LUKE It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the Jawa leader. OWEN I have no need for a protocol droid. THREEPIO (quickly) Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... OWEN What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. THREEPIO Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter... very similar to your vaporators. You could say... OWEN Do you speak Bocce? THREEPIO Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me... I'm as fluent in Bocce... OWEN All right shut up! (turning to Jawa) I'll take this one. THREEPIO Shutting up, sir. OWEN Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner. LUKE But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters... OWEN You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it! LUKE All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go. As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box. Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly. LUKE Uncle Owen... OWEN Yeah? LUKE This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look! OWEN (to the head Jawa) Hey, what're you trying to push on us? The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder. THREEPIO (pointing to Artoo) Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain. LUKE Uncle Owen... OWEN Yeah? LUKE What about that one? OWEN (to Jawa) What about that blue one? We'll take that one. With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro-droid for Artoo. LUKE Yeah, take it away. THREEPIO Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry. LUKE Okay, let's go. THREEPIO (to Artoo) Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face. THREEPIO Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench. LUKE It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here! THREEPIO Is there anything I might do to help? Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face. LUKE Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! THREEPIO I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on. LUKE Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. THREEPIO I see, sir. LUKE Uh, you can call me Luke. THREEPIO I see, sir Luke. LUKE (laughing) Just Luke. THREEPIO And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo. LUKE Hello. Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body. LUKE You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action. THREEPIO With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all. LUKE You know of the Rebellion against the Empire? THREEPIO That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir. LUKE Have you been in many battles? THREEPIO Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways. Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's neck joint. He uses a larger pick. LUKE Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or... The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three- dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe. LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. LUKE What's this? Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over. THREEPIO What is what?!? He asked you a question... (pointing to Leia) What is that? Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over. LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. THREEPIO Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl. LUKE Who is she? She's beautiful. THREEPIO I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. LEIA Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... THREEPIO I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... LUKE Is there more to this recording? Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle. THREEPIO Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master. Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio. THREEPIO He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. LUKE Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? THREEPIO I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? LUKE Well, I don't know anyone named Obi- Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments. LUKE I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing. Artoo beeps something to Threepio. THREEPIO He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying. LUKE H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off Artoo's side. LUKE There you go. The princess immediately disappears... LUKE Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in embarrassment. THREEPIO What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! A women's voice calls out from another room. AUNT BERU Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning robot. LUKE All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. THREEPIO I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out of the room. LUKE Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. THREEPIO (to Artoo) Just you reconsider playing that message for him. Artoo beeps in response. THREEPIO No, I don't think he likes you at all. Artoo beeps. THREEPIO No, I don't like you either. INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well- used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining area. Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red grain. LUKE You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. OWEN What makes you think that? LUKE Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but manages to control himself. LUKE I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger. OWEN That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. LUKE But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? OWEN He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. LUKE He knew my father? OWEN I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers. LUKE Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year. Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it. OWEN You mean the next semester before harvest? LUKE Sure, there're more than enough droids. OWEN Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year. Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle. OWEN You must understand I need you here, Luke. LUKE But it's a whole 'nother year. OWEN Look, it's only one more season. Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands. LUKE Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. AUNT BERU Where are you going? LUKE It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids. Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen mechanically finishes his dinner. AUNT BERU Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him. OWEN I'll make it up to him next year. I promise. AUNT BERU Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him. OWEN That's what I'm afraid of. EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the homestead. INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship. LUKE What are you doing hiding there? Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in sight. THREEPIO It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission. LUKE Oh, no! Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio. EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro- robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars. THREEPIO That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. LUKE How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! THREEPIO Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? LUKE It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Owen yells up from the homestead plaza. OWEN Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. LUKE All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. He takes one final look across the dim horizon. LUKE You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. THREEPIO Oh, he excels at that, sir. INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead. OWEN Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now! INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff. OWEN Have you seen Luke this morning? AUNT BERU He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early. OWEN Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him? AUNT BERU I think so. OWEN Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay! EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast wasteland. INT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING - DAY Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something in the motor compartment. LUKE (yelling) How's that. Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut. LUKE Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must have missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well. THREEPIO Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault. LUKE (brightening) Sure. He needs you. He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so... THREEPIO Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt... LUKE Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator. EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the gun before it can be fired. The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain. EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged bluff. EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands before little Artoo. LUKE Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going? The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway. THREEPIO Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. LUKE Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up. THREEPIO If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop. LUKE No, he's not going to try anything. Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles and screams. LUKE What's wrong with him now? THREEPIO Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south. LUKE Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on. EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young adventurer. LUKE There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now. Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down the side of the mountain. The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible shrieking laugh. EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder. The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the Sandpeople fleeing in terror. Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him. BEN Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on Luke's forehead and he begins to come around. BEN Don't worry, he'll be all right. LUKE What happened? BEN Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. LUKE Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! BEN The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? LUKE Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about? Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard. BEN Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time. LUKE I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead. BEN Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet. LUKE You know him! BEN Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. LUKE Then the droid does belong to you. BEN Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs. BEN I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around. LUKE Threepio! EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off. Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical man's systems turn on. THREEPIO Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... LUKE Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return. THREEPIO I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. Artoo makes a beeping sound. LUKE No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air. BEN Quickly, son... they're on the move. INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as old Ben sits thinking. LUKE No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter. BEN That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved. LUKE You fought in the Clone Wars? BEN Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father. LUKE I wish I'd known him. BEN He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me... Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around. As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously. Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle with several electronic gadgets attached to it. BEN I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. THREEPIO Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile. LUKE Sure, go ahead. Ben hands Luke the saber. LUKE What is it? BEN Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster. Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across the ceiling. BEN An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire. Luke hasn't really been listening. LUKE How did my father die? BEN A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force. LUKE The Force? BEN Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together. Artoo makes beeping sounds. BEN Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from. LUKE I saw part of the message he was... Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face. BEN I seem to have found it. Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before his eyes. LEIA General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope. There is a little static and the transmission is cut short. Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes. BEN You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan. LUKE (laughing) Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. BEN I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. LUKE I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. BEN That's your uncle talking. LUKE (sighing) Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this? BEN Learn about the Force, Luke. LUKE Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. BEN You must do what you feel is right, of course. EXT. SPACE. An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like battle station: the Death Star! INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is speaking. TAGGE Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair. MOTTI Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! TAGGE The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.... Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind him. TARKIN The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. TAGGE That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? TARKIN The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station. TAGGE And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it. VADER The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. MOTTI Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it! VADER Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. MOTTI Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort... Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's spell. VADER I find your lack of faith disturbing. TARKIN Enough of this! Vader, release him! VADER As you wish. TARKIN This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke. EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble and scattered bodies. LUKE It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before. Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks. BEN They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers. LUKE These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio. BEN And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise. LUKE Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas? Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together. LUKE If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home! Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for the speeder and jumps it. BEN Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous. Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the burning Sandcrawler. EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder. EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has taken place. LUKE Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen! Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle. Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new resolve comes over him. EXT. SPACE Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star. INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader. VADER And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base. The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard. EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the dead. Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to him. BEN There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire. LUKE I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father. EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where Ben is standing. BEN Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious. Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined smile. EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat- hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper questions Luke. TROOPER How long have you had these droids? LUKE About three or four seasons. BEN They're for sale if you want them. TROOPER Let me see your identification. Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice. BEN You don't need to see his identification. TROOPER We don't need to see his identification. BEN These are not the droids your looking for. TROOPER These are not the droids we're looking for. BEN He can go about his business. TROOPER You can go about your business. BEN (to Luke) Move along. TROOPER Move along. Move along. EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle the speeder. THREEPIO I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa away. LUKE Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead. BEN The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally. LUKE Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan? BEN Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough. LUKE I'm ready for anything. THREEPIO Come along, Artoo. INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender stops Luke and the robots. BARTENDER We don't serve their kind here! Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's drift. LUKE What? BARTENDER Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here. Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare. Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder. LUKE Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble. THREEPIO I heartily agree with you sir. Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the creatures at the bar go back to their drinks. Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage- looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur- covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance. Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a sight to behold. Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between Ben and the giant Wookiee. Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear or whatever. A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove. CREATURE Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the belligerent monstrosity. HUMAN He doesn't like you. LUKE I'm sorry. HUMAN I don't like you either. The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young adventurer. HUMAN Don't insult us. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. LUKE I'll be careful than. HUMAN You'll be dead. The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind Luke. BEN This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something... A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. The bartender panics. BARTENDER No blasters! No blaster! With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben points the the Wookiee. BEN This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs. EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on an electronic conversation with another little red astro- droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches two stormtroopers in the street. THREEPIO I don't like the look of this. INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, and cocksure. HAN Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system. BEN Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship. HAN Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon? BEN Should I have? HAN It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs! Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation. HAN I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo? BEN Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked. HAN What is it? Some kind of local trouble? BEN Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements. HAN Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance. LUKE Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that! HAN But who's going to fly it, kid! You? LUKE You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen... BEN We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan. HAN Seventeen, huh! Han ponders this for a few moments. HAN Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four. BEN Ninety-four. HAN Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork. Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some questions. The bartender points to the booth. TROOPER All right, we'll check it out. The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement. HAN Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready. EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET BEN You'll have to sell your speeder. LUKE That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again. INT. MOS EISLEY - CANTINA As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles. GREEDO Going somewhere, Solo? HAN Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money. Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the gun on him. GREEDO It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first. HAN Yeah, but this time I got the money. GREEDO If you give it to me, I might forget I found you. HAN I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba... GREEDO Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser. HAN Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice? Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table. GREEDO You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship. HAN Over my dead body. GREEDO That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time. HAN Yes, I'll bet you have. Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some coins as he leaves. HAN Sorry about the mess. EXT. SPACE Several TIE fighters approach the Death Star. INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM VADER Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her. An Imperial Officer interrupts the meeting. IMPERIAL OFFICER The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set? TARKIN Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. VADER What do you mean? TARKIN I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. (to soldier) Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. TROOPER With pleasure. EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and hiding from the hot winds. THREEPIO Lock the door, Artoo. One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background. TROOPER All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door. The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway. THREEPIO I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. Artoo makes beeping sounds. THREEPIO You watch your language! EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET - ALLEYWAY - USED SPEEDER LOT Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins. LUKE He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they're just not in demand. BEN It will be enough. Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as they disappear down another alley. BEN If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well. INT. DOCKING BAY 94 - DAY Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and a huge ugly mouth. JABBA Come on out, Solo! A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight. HAN I've been waiting for you, Jabba. JABBA I expected you would be. HAN I'm not the type to run. JABBA (fatherly-smooth) Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together. HAN You sent Greedo to blast me. JABBA (mock surprise) Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business. You're too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern at your delays. He wasn't going to blast you. HAN I think he thought he was. Next time don't send one of those twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself. JABBA Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception. Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good business. HAN You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time. JABBA (to his men) Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you. So, for an extra, say twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it. If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life. HAN Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure. EXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY - ALLEYWAY Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 94. Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street. Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder lot. He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small transmitter. INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94 Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that could only loosely be called a starship. LUKE What a piece of junk. The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp. HAN She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself. Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others to follow. HAN We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here. The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han Solo. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty engines of the starship. INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94 Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium Falcon passing Solo. THREEPIO Hello, sir. EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad creature. TROOPER Which way? The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking bay. TROOPER All right, men. Load your weapons! INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94] The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the docking bay entrance. TROOPER Stop that ship! Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as he ducks into the spaceship. TROOPER Blast 'em! Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that slams the overhead entry shut. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON HAN Chewie, get us out of here! The group straps in for take off. THREEPIO Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel. EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the morning sky. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope. EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT Han frantically types information into the ship's computer. Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away. HAN It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial stardestroyers. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation. HAN Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off. LUKE Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. HAN Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window. HAN Here's where the fun begins! BEN How long before you can make the jump to light speed? HAN It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer. The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it. LUKE Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining... HAN Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it? The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red warning light begins to flash. LUKE What's that flashing? HAN We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed. The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship makes the jump to hyperspace. EXT. SPACE The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a second. EXT. DEATH STAR Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation. INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen displaying a small green planet. MOTTI We've entered the Alderaan system. Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her hands are bound. LEIA Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. TARKIN Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! LEIA I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself! TARKIN Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now. LEIA The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. TARKIN Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan. LEIA No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... TARKIN You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system! Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia. TARKIN I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base? Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to Alderaan. LEIA (softly) Dantooine. Leia lowers her head. LEIA They're on Dantooine. TARKIN There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. (addressing Motti) Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready. LEIA What? TARKIN You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. LEIA No! INT. DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER VADER Commence primary ignition. A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan. The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker" robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, seems almost faint. LUKE Are you all right? What's wrong? BEN I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then he fixes his gaze on Luke. BEN You'd better get on with your exercises. Han Solo enters the room. HAN Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber. HAN Don't everyone thank me at once. Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move along a chess-type board. HAN Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- covered arms over his head. THREEPIO Now be careful, Artoo. Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge Wookiee. THREEPIO He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. HAN (interrupting) Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. THREEPIO But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. HAN That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. THREEPIO I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win. Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements. Han watches with a bit of smugness. BEN Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. LUKE You mean it controls your actions? BEN Partially. But it also obeys your commands. Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter. HAN Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. LUKE You don't believe in the Force, do you? HAN Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. Ben smiles quietly. HAN It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. BEN I suggest you try it again, Luke. Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his eyes. BEN This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. LUKE (laughing) With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight? BEN Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker. BEN Stretch out with your feelings. Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position. BEN You see, you can do it. HAN I call it luck. BEN In my experience, there's no such thing as luck. HAN Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else. Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel. HAN Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan. Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit. LUKE You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote. BEN That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world. INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the evil Dark Lord Darth Vader. TARKIN Yes. OFFICER CASS Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems. TARKIN She lied! She lied to us! VADER I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion. TARKIN Terminate her... immediately! EXT. HYPERSPACE The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange surreal light show surrounds the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT HAN Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering the sides of the ship. HAN What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing cockpit. LUKE What's going on? HAN Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan! LUKE What do you mean? Where is it? HAN Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. LUKE What? How? Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to settle down. BEN Destroyed... by the Empire! HAN The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've... A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming. HAN There's another ship coming in. LUKE Maybe they know what happened. BEN It's an Imperial fighter. Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window. LUKE It followed us! BEN No. It's a short range fighter. HAN There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from? EXT. SPACE The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT LUKE It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble. HAN Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions. BEN It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range. HAN Not for long... EXT. SPACE The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben stands behind Chewbacca. BEN A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. LUKE It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something. HAN Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. EXT. SPACE The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as they race toward camera and disappear over head. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or planet. LUKE Look at him. He's headed for that small moon. HAN I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range. The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous spherical battle station. BEN That's no moon! It's a space station. HAN It's too big to be a space station. LUKE I have a very bad feeling about this. HAN Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power. The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away toward the gargantuan battle station. LUKE Why are we still moving towards it? HAN We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in! LUKE But there's gotta be something you can do! HAN There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight! Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder. BEN You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DEATH STAR As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station becomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which the helpless pirateship is dragged. EXT. DEATH STAR - HUGE PORT DOORS The helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port control room and huge laser turret cannons. VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM Clear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic field. INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037 The pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death Star, coming to rest in a huge hangar. Thirty stormtroopers stand at attention in a central assembly area. OFFICER To you stations! (to another officer) Come with me. INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY Stormtroopers run to their posts. INT. DEATH STAR - HANGAR 2037 A line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in readiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons ready to fire. OFFICER Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields! INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM Tarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz. TARKIN Yes. VOICE (over intercom) We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley. VADER They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us. INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037 Vader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft. VOICE (over intercom) Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges. OFFICER (to Vader) There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned. VADER Did you find any droids? OFFICER No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned. VADER Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked. OFFICER Yes, sir. VADER I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since... Vader turns quickly and exits the hangar. OFFICER Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HALLWAY A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In a few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his head out of a third locker. LUKE Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments. HAN I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam. BEN Leave that to me! HAN Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that! BEN Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him? Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees. INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp. TROOPER The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound is followed by a voice calling to the guard below. HAN'S VOICE Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire is heard. INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE In a very small command office near the entrance to the pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink. GANTRY OFFICER TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed look. GANTRY OFFICER Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet. LUKE You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. HAN Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. THREEPIO We found the computer outlet, sir. Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel. Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly. BEN Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network. Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something. THREEPIO He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The computer monitor flashes readouts. THREEPIO The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. Ben studies the data on the monitor readout. BEN I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. HAN Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. LUKE I want to go with you. BEN Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. LUKE But he can... BEN They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you... always! Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head in agreement. HAN Boy you said it, Chewie. Han looks at Luke. HAN Where did you dig up that old fossil? LUKE Ben is a great man. HAN Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. LUKE I didn't hear you give any ideas... HAN Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up... LUKE Who do you think... Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak. Luke goes over to him. LUKE What is it? THREEPIO I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says "I found her", and keeps repeating, "She's here." LUKE Well, who... who has he found? Artoo whistles a frantic reply. THREEPIO Princess Leia. LUKE The princess? She's here? HAN Princess? What's going on? THREEPIO Level five. Detention block A A-twenty- three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. LUKE Oh, no! We've got to do something. HAN What are you talking about? LUKE The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message... We've got to help her. HAN Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. LUKE But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block? HAN I'm not going anywhere. LUKE They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. HAN Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind. LUKE But they're going to kill her! HAN Better her than me... LUKE She's rich. Chewbacca growls. HAN Rich? LUKE Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... HAN What? LUKE Well more wealth that you can imagine. HAN I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! LUKE You'll get it! HAN I better! LUKE You will... HAN All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this. Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt. LUKE All right. HAN What's your plan? LUKE Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you? Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs. LUKE Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you. Chewie lets out a hideous growl. LUKE Okay. Han, you put these on. Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han. HAN Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind. The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs. THREEPIO Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here? LUKE Lock the door! HAN And hope they don't have blasters. THREEPIO That isn't very reassuring. Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and start off into the giant Imperial Death Star. INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious glance. Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters. LUKE I can't see a thing in this helmet. A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube. INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. No one in the hallway seems to notice him. INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY AREA Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath. HAN This is not going to work. LUKE Why didn't you say so before? HAN I did say so before! INT. DETENTION AREA Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches the trio. OFFICER Where are you taking this... thing? Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut up. LUKE Prisoner transfer from Block one-one- three-eight. OFFICER I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it. The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in the information. There are only three other troopers in the area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke. Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle. HAN Look out! He's loose! LUKE He's going to pull us all apart. HAN Go get him! The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink system, which is screeching questions about what is going on. He quickly checks the computer readout. HAN We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here. Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into the buzzing comlink. HAN (sounding official) Everything is under control. Situation normal. INTERCOM VOICE What happened? HAN (getting nervous) Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you? INTERCOM VOICE We're sending a squad up. HAN Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous. INTERCOM VOICE Who is this? What's your operating number? Han blasts the comlink and it explodes. HAN Boring conversation anyway. (yelling down the hall) Luke! We're going to have company! INT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands staring at her with his mouth hanging open. LEIA (finally) Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper? Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it. LUKE What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. LEIA You're who? LUKE I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi. LEIA Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he? LUKE Come on! INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the far end of the conference table. VADER He is here... TARKIN Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so? VADER A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. TARKIN Surely he must be dead by now. VADER Don't underestimate the power of the Force. TARKIN The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. There is a quiet buzz on the comlink. TARKIN Yes. INTERCOM VOICE Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty- three. TARKIN The princess! Put all sections on alert! VADER Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. TARKIN If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. VADER Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone. INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - HALLWAY An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the elevator door. HAN Chewie! Chewbacca responds with a growling noise. HAN Get behind me! Get behind me! A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge. Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them. HAN Can't get out that way. LEIA Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. HAN (sarcastically) Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their way down the corridor. LUKE See-Threepio! See-Threepio! THREEPIO (over comlink) Yes sir? LUKE We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?... What was that? I didn't copy! INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink transmitter. THREEPIO I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted. Someone begins banging on the door. TROOPER VOICE Open up in there! THREEPIO Oh, no! INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor. LUKE There isn't any other way out. HAN I can't hold them off forever! Now what? LEIA This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out? HAN (pointing to Luke) He's the brains, sweetheart. Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders. LUKE Well, I didn't... The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in the wall next to Han, almost frying him. HAN What the hell are you doing? LEIA Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy. She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says something. HAN Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it. Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their way toward the opening. HAN Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there! Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then slides into the chute himself and is gone. INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck. Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't budge. HAN (sarcastically) Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there... LUKE No! wait! Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room. Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face. LUKE Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed! LEIA Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed. HAN Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us. LEIA It could be worse... A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls. HAN It's worse. LUKE There's something alive in here! HAN That's your imagination. LUKE Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that? HAN What? LUKE Help! Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage. HAN Luke! Luke! Luke! Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around his throat. LEIA Luke! Leia extends a long pipe toward him. LEIA Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this. LUKE Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed. HAN Where? LUKE Anywhere! Oh!! Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the muck by the slimy tentacle. HAN Luke! Luke! Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet. Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke suddenly bobs to the surface. LEIA Grab him! Luke seems to be released by the thing. LEIA What happened? LUKE I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared... HAN I've got a very bad feeling about this. Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and edge toward the Rebels. LUKE The walls are moving! LEIA Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something. They place poles and long metal beams between the closing walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good. LUKE Wait a minute! Luke pulls out his comlink. LUKE Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be? INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber. FIRST TROOPER Take over! (pointing to the dead officer) See to him! Look there! A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows his bronze companion out into the office. THREEPIO They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. FIRST OFFICER (to his troops) Follow me! You stand guard. The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to watch over the command office. THREEPIO (to Artoo) Come on! The guard aims a blaster at them. THREEPIO Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. TROOPER All right. The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries out the door. INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller. Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws. Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio. LUKE Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. Leia begins to sink into the trash. HAN Get to the top! LEIA I can't LUKE Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL THREEPIO They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from the tiny robot. THREEPIO Hurry! INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels the first crushing pressure against her body. HAN One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! (to Leia) Get on top of it! LEIA I'm trying! INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL THREEPIO (to Artoo) Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio. THREEPIO Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his head above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz and he rips it off his belt. INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard, but not distinctly. THREEPIO Are you there, sir? INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM LUKE Threepio! INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL THREEPIO We've had some problems... LUKE (over comlink) Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM LUKE Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL LUKE (over comlink) Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. THREEPIO (to Artoo) No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink. THREEPIO Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! LUKE (over comlink) Threepio, we're all right! INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace in the background. LUKE We're all right. You did great. Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a number. LUKE Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we? INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL HAN (over comlink) Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. INT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading to a control panel that connects two large cables. He carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, and several lights on the board go from red to blue. INT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway. Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster belts. HAN If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here. Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster from Solo. LUKE Well, let's get moving! Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage room, as he runs away and then stops howling. HAN (to Chewie) Where are you going? The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a victim. Han aims his pistol. LEIA No, wait. They'll hear! Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply shakes his head in disgust. HAN (to Chewie) Come here, you big coward! Chewie shakes his head "no." HAN Chewie! Come here! LEIA Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl. HAN Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one person! Me! LEIA It's a wonder you're still alive. (looking at Chewie) Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way? Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke. HAN No reward is worth this. They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor. INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few feet of him. OFFICER Secure this area until the alert is canceled. FIRST TROOPER Give me regular reports. All but two of the stormtroopers leave. FIRST TROOPER Do you know what's going on? SECOND TROOPER Maybe it's another drill. Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips past the troopers and into the main hallway. SECOND TROOPER What was that? FIRST TROOPER Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it. INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink. HAN (looking at his ship) There she is. LUKE See-Threepio, do you copy? THREEPIO (voice) For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship. LUKE We're right above you. Stand by. Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and points out the window to the ship. LEIA You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought. HAN Nice! Come on! Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are taken by surprise and stop in their tracks. FIRST TROOPER It's them! Blast them! Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor. HAN (to Luke and Leia) Get back to the ship! LUKE Where are you going? Come back! Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear. LEIA He certainly has courage. LUKE What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on! Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke and Leia start off toward the starship hangar. INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are moving into an attack position in front of the lone starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him. INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running the other way also. INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an open hatchway. INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of his arm and pulls him back. LUKE (gasping) I think we took a wrong turn. Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang. Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door. LEIA There's no lock! Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol. LUKE That oughta hold it for a while. LEIA Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge. LUKE Oh, I think I just blasted it. Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making ominous drilling and pounding sounds. LEIA They're coming through! Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, and grabs at his chest. Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia. LUKE Here, hold this. Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well. Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet of more troops. LEIA Here they come! Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised. LEIA For luck! Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into the tiny subhallway. INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of the hallway and starts after the old Jedi. INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the pirateship entry ramp. THREEPIO Where could they be? Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left and right, beeping a response. INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several troopers hot on their trail. TROOPER Close the blast doors! At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops before the doors slam shut. TROOPER Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors! INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his and steps slowly forward. VADER I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete. Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance. VADER When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master. BEN Only a master of evil, Darth. The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes. Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound. VADER Your powers are weak, old man. BEN You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine. Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat. INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar. HAN Didn't we just leave this party? Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them. HAN What kept you? LEIA We ran into some old friends. LUKE Is the ship all right? HAN Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission. INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his group's vantage point. LUKE Look! Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking bay. INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's Imperial docking bay. THREEPIO Come on, Artoo, we're going! Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo. INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The troops rush toward the battling knights. HAN Now's our chance! Go! They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to deflect the blow and swiftly turns around. The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene look on his face. Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it. Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out. LUKE No! The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him. The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down. HAN (to Luke) Come on! LEIA Come on! Luke, its too late! HAN Blast the door! Kid! Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor. BEN'S VOICE Run, Luke! Run! Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the troopers and races into the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the ship as Chewie adjusts his controls. HAN I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! Chewbacca growls in agreement. EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness of space. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She sits down beside him. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT Solo spots approaching enemy ships. HAN (to Chewie) We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, as the princess smiles comfortingly at him. LUKE I can't believe he's gone. Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply. LEIA There wasn't anything you could have done. Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the princess. HAN (to Luke) Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT Solo climbs into his attack position in the topside gunport. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA Luke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as Leia heads for the cockpit. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large rotating turrets on either side of the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SOLO'S GUNPORT Han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone. HAN (to Luke) You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking TIE fighters. The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls as the ship bounces slightly. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SOLO'S GUNPORT - COCKPIT Computer graphic readouts form on Solo's target screen, as Han reaches for controls. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT - COCKPIT Luke sits in readiness for the attack, his hand on the laser cannon's control button. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT. Chewbacca spots the enemy ships and barks. LEIA (into intercom) Here they come! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - POV (POINT OF VIEW) - SPACE The Imperial TIE fighters move towards the Millennium Falcon, one each veering off to the left and right of the pirateship. INT. TIE FIGHTER - COCKPIT The stars whip past behind the Imperial pilot as he adjusts his maneuvering joy stick. EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - IN SPACE The TIE fighter races past the Falcon, firing laser beams as it passes. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA Threepio is seated in the hold area, next to Artoo-Detoo. The pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out in the room and then comes back on. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - GUNPORTS A TIE fighter maneuvers in front of Han, who follows it and fires at it with the laser cannon. Luke does likewise, as the fighter streaks into view. The ship has suffered a minor hit, and bounces slightly. EXT. SPACE Two TIE fighters dive down toward the pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS Luke fires at an unseen fighter. LUKE They're coming in too fast! EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON/TIE FIGHTERS Pan with pirateship as two TIE fighters charge through the background. Laserbolts streak from all the craft. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CHEWBACCA The ship shudders as a laserbolt hits very close to the cockpit. The Wookiee chatters something to Leia. EXT. TIE FIGHTER - SPACE Full shot of a TIE fighter as it moves fast through the frame, firing on the pirate starship. EXT. SPACE - TIE FIGHTERS The two TIE fighters fire a barrage of laserbeams at the pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN PASSAGEWAY A laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. The ship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet fill of small computer chips. THREEPIO Oooh! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - GUNPORTS Leia watches the computer readout as Chewbacca manipulates the ship's controls. LEIA We've lost lateral controls. HAN Don't worry, she'll hold together. An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel, causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks. HAN (to ship) You hear me, baby? Hold together! Artoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant beeping all the while. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT Luke swivels in his gun mount, following the TIE fighter with his laser cannon. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT Solo aims his laser cannon at the enemy fighter. EXT. SPACE A TIE fighter streaks in front of the starship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT Leia watches the TIE fighter ship fly over. EXT. SPACE A TIE fighter heads right for the pirateship, then zooms overhead. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS Luke follows the TIE fighter across his field of view, firing laserbeams from his cannon. EXT. TIE FIGHTER A TIE fighter dives past the pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS Luke fires at a TIE fighter. At his port, Han follows a fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. He connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. Han laughs victoriously. EXT. SPACE Two TIE fighters move toward and over the Millennium Falcon, unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS Another TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke, smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular direct hit. LUKE Got him! I got him! Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully returns. HAN Great kid! Don't get cocky. Han turns back to his laser cannon. EXT. SPACE Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking over her shoulder out the ports. LEIA There are still two more of them out there! EXT. SPACE A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts at it. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS Luke and Han look into their respective projected target screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his face. EXT. SPACE The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing destructive blasts at it. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, and it bursts into a spectacular explosion. Luke's projected screen gives a readout of the hit. The pirateship bounces slightly as it is struck by the enemy fire. EXT. SPACE - TIE FIGHTER The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in, firing upon the Falcon. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower of burning fragments. LUKE (laughing) That's it! We did it! The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug. LEIA We did it! INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - PASSAGEWAY Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled in the smoking, sparking wires. THREEPIO Help! I think I'm melting! (to Artoo) This is all your fault. Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response. EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically through space. INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is watching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before him. TARKIN Are they away? VADER They have just made the jump into hyperspace. TARKIN You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work. INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the damage. Leia is seated near Han. HAN Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. LEIA That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. HAN Easy... you call that easy? LEIA Their tracking us! HAN Not this ship, sister. Frustrated, Leia shakes her head. LEIA At least the information in Artoo is still intact. HAN What's so important? What's he carrying? LEIA The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet! HAN It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money! LEIA You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive! She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, passes Luke coming in. LEIA Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone. LUKE I care! Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han stare out at the vast blackness of space. LUKE So... what do you think of her, Han? HAN I'm trying not to, kid! LUKE (under his breath) Good... HAN Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... LUKE No! Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at young Luke's jealousy. EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons. EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN The pirateship soars over the dense jungle. EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside. He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely visible in the foliage. EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE TEMPLE Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the others are greeted by the Rebel troops. Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored military speeder. INT. MASSASSI - MAIN HANGAR DECK The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her. WILLARD (holding Leia) You're safe! We had feared the worst. Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally. WILLARD When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father. LEIA We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. (looking pointedly to Han) It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. EXT. SPACE The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red planet Yavin. INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer the call. TARKIN Yes. DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet. EXT. YAVIN - JUNGLE A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape, surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of twisted green. INT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia and several other senators are to one side of the giant readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and Chewbacca are standing near the back. DODONNA The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed around a direct large- scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense. Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands and addresses Dodonna. GOLD LEADER Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that? DODONNA Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station. Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping sounds, and turns his head from right to left. DODONNA The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station. A murmer of disbelief runs through the room. DODONNA Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray- shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about sixteen years old. WEDGE That's impossible, even for a computer. LUKE It's not impossible. I used to bull's- eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. DODONNA Man your ships! And may the Force be with you! The group rises and begins to leave. EXT. SPACE The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the tiny green moon. INT. DEATH STAR Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and the forth moon. DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes. VADER This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters. Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes onto an armored speeder. MAN'S VOICE (over loudspeaker) All flight trooper, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations. Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of his friend's departure. LUKE So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then? HAN That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you. LUKE (getting angry) Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them. HAN What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide. LUKE All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it? Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him. HAN Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you! Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in a small wave and then goes off. Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain, HAN What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing. INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter. LEIA What's wrong? LUKE Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. LEIA He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. LUKE I only wish Ben were here. Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs his arm. BIGGS Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you get here... are you going out with us?! LUKE Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there with you! Listen, have I got some stories to tell... Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born leader. RED LEADER Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty- five? BIGGS Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories. Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of his fighter. RED LEADER I met your father once when I was just a boy, he was a great pilot. You'll do all right. If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right. LUKE Thank you, sir. I'll try. Red Leader hurries to his own ship. BIGGS I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back. All right? LUKE I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs. BIGGS (going off) You did, all right. It's going to be like old times, Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped! Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for his ship. As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the back of the fighter. CHIEF This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? LUKE Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. (to Artoo) You okay, Artoo? The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps that he is fine. Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo beeps good-bye. CHIEF Okay, easy she goes! THREEPIO Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. Artoo beeps in agreement. THREEPIO You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Artoo whistles his reply. All final preparations are made for the approaching battle. The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles. BEN'S VOICE Luke, the Force will be with you. Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones. EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud cover. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its four moons.

ASTRO-OFFICER We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers! VADER We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. INT. DEATH STAR Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming noise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet with his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing. INT.

Luke climbs down the ladder as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting. Princess Leia rushes toward him. LEIA Luke! Luke! Luke! She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance around in a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they embrace one another, slapping each other on the back. HAN (laughing) Hey! Hey! LUKE (laughing) I knew you'd come back! I just knew it! HAN Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward. Luke and Han look at one another, as Solo playfully shoves at Luke's face. Leia moves in between them. LEIA (laughing) Hey, I knew there was more to you than money. Luke looks toward the ship. LUKE Oh, no! The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio. THREEPIO Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! (to mechanic) You can repair him, can't you? TECHNICIAN We'll get to work on him right away. THREEPIO You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them. LUKE He'll be all right. INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful. She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo beeps with happiness. FADE OUT: END CREDITS OVER STARS THE END  Written by Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett From a story by George LucasEXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTHA Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots from its underside. One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-covered surface. An explosion marks the point ofimpact. EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAYA weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind. A strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the smoke-shrouded crater. The ominous mechanical probe floats across the snow plain and disappears into the distance.EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAYA small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope. The bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun. Curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged beast.The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop. Pulling off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the sky. He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink transmitter. His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.LUKE(into comlink)Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me?After a little static a familiar voice is heard.HAN(over comlink)Loud and clear, kid. What's up?LUKE(into comlink)Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.HAN(over comlink)There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed, I'm going back.LUKE(into comlink)Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard. He pats the beast on the head to calm it.LUKEHey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind. He hears a monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over him. It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.LUKEAaargh!Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white claw. He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck being broken.The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away across the frozen plain.EXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAYA stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous ice cave.INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECKRebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing their new base. The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls off his goggles.He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which is parked among several fighters. Mechanics, R2 units, and various other droids hurry about. Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter. Chewie stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated greeting to his boss.HANChewie!The Wookiee grumbles a reply.HANAll right, don't lose your temper.I'll come right back and give you a hand.Chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han leaves.INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTERA makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick ice. The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers, troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and monitoring radar signals.General Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's approach.RIEEKANSolo?HANNo sign of life out there, General.The sensors are in place. You'll know if anything comes around.RIEEKANCommander Skywalker reported in yet?HANNo. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.RIEEKAN(indicates radar screen)With all the meteor activity in thissystem, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.Taking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind.HANGeneral, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore.Princess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short white combat jacket and pants. Her hair is braided across her head in a Nordic fashion. She overhears their conversation and seems somewhat distressed.RIEEKANI'm sorry to hear that.HANWell, there's a price on my head.If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man.RIEEKANA death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a goodfighter, Solo. I hate to lose you.HANThank you, General.He turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away.HAN(with feeling)Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.LEIAThat's right.Leia is angry. Han sees she has no warmth to offer him. He shakes his head and adopts a sarcastic tone.HAN(cooly)Well, don't get all mushy on me.So long, Princess.Han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center. Leia stews a moment, then hurries after him.INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDORLEIAHan!Han stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia.HANYes, Your Highnessness?LEIAI thought you decided to stay.HANWell, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed mymind. LEIAHan, we need you!HANWe?LEIAYes.HANOh, what about you need?LEIA(mystified)I need? I don't know what you're talking about.HAN(shakes his head, fed up) You probably don't.LEIAAnd what precisely am I supposed to know?HANCome on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel aboutme.LEIAYes. You're a great help to us.You're a natural leader...HANNo! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh - uh huh! Come on.Leia stares at him, understanding, then laughs.LEIAYou're imagining things.HANAm I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leavewithout giving you a goodbye kiss?LEIAI'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.HANI can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!Angrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him.INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ANOTHER ICE CORRIDORA familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo-Detoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an ice wall toward the main hangar.THREEPIODon't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess' chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.THREEPIOOh, switch off.INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECKThe two robots stop at Han Solo's space freighter. Han and Chewie are struggling with their central lifters.HAN(to Chewie)Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these.Chewie grumbles in irritation.THREEPIOExcuse me, sir.HAN(to Chewie)Put them back together right now.THREEPIOMight I have a word with you, please?HANWhat do you want?THREEPIOWell, it's Princess Leia, sir.She's been trying to get you on the communicator.HANI turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.THREEPIOOh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.HANI don't know where he is.THREEPIONobody knows where he is.HANWhat do you mean, "nobody knows"?Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as night slowly begins to fall on the planet.THREEPIOWell, uh, you see...Han jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him.HANDeck Officer. Deck Officer!THREEPIOExcuse me, sir. Might I inqu...Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer approaches.DECK OFFICERYes, sir?HANDo you know where Commander Skywalker is?DECK OFFICERI haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance.HANIt's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there.DECK OFFICERYes, sir.The deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio's mouth.THREEPIOExcuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?HANWhy not?THREEPIOImpossible man. Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNELThe deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the tunnel.DECK OFFICERSir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance.He might have forgotten to check in.HANNot likely. Are the speeders ready?DECK OFFICERNot yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold.HANThen we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.DECK OFFICERSir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly.HANThat's right. And my friends out in it.ASSISTANT OFFICERI'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha.Han pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun.DECK OFFICERYour Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker.HANThen I'll see you in hell!Han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter night.EXT. HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSKThe jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of a Hoth day. Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor. One side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood. He opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls. Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position. As he hangs there, he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about three feet out of reach.He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into Luke's hand.The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts himself loose from the ice. He flops to the snow in a heap. The startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking. Luke scrambles to his feet. He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams in pain.EXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSKLuke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight. Weak and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DUSKA small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile vastness of snow and cold. As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.EXT. HOTH - OUTSIDE ICE HANGAR - DUSKArtoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly. Threepio moves stiffly over to him.THREEPIOYou must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up.Artoo beeps, long and low.THREEPIODon't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again.He'll be quite all right, you'll see.(to himself)Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right.Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully keeps his vigil.EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSKThe wind is blowing quite strong now. Luke struggles to stay upright, but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over. He struggles to get up, but he can't. The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple of feet and then collapses.INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHTPrincess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base, waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes. She shivers in the cold wind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands. In the background, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors. A Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with the princess.LIEUTENANTSir, all the patrols are in.There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.THREEPIOMistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.Leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.DERLINYour Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed.He turns to the lieutenant.DERLINClose the doors.LIEUTENANTYes, sir.The lieutenant walks away. Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, somewhat like a coyote. At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex series of efficient beeps.THREEPIOArtoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one.Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the entrance of the ice cave. The loud booms echo throughout the huge cavern. Chewie lets out another suffering howl.THREEPIOActually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time.Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know... for a human being.EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSKLuke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious. Slowly he looks up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow. It is hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination.BENLuke... Luke.LUKE(weakly)Ben?BENYou will go to the Dagobah system.LUKEDagobah system?BENThere you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.The image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching from the windswept horizon.LUKE(groaning faintly)Ben... Ben.Luke drops into unconsciousness.Han pulls up and leaps off his mount. He hurries to his snow-covered friend, cradling him in his arms. Han's Tauntaun lets out a low, pitiful bellow. But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him urgently.HANLuke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here.Luke doesn't respond. Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping Luke's unconscious face. As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a rasping sound behind him. He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun stagger and then fall over into the snow.Han carries Luke to the moaning beast. Then, with a final groan, the Tauntaun expires.HAN Not much time.He pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.LUKE(moaning)Ben... Ben...HANHang on, kid.LUKEDagobah system...Han ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe. He quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.HAN(reeling from the odor) Whew...LUKEDagobah...HANThis may smell bad, kid...LUKE(moaning)Yoda...HAN...but it will keep you warm... til I get the shelter built.(struggling to get Luke inside the carcass) Ooh... I thought they smelled bad on the outside!The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move. Han removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter container. He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection against a bitter Hoth night.EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAWNFour snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape.INT. SNOWSPEEDER COCKPITThere is only one pilot, Zev, in the enclosed two-man craft. He concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit. He hears a low beep from one of his monitors.ZEV(into transmitter) Echo Base... I've got something! Not much, but it could be a life form.EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFTThe small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new direction.INT. SNOWSPEEDER - COCKPITThe pilot switches over to a new transmitter.ZEV(into transmitter)This is Rogue Two. this is Rogue Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rogue Two.There is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice.HAN(filtered over Zev's receiver)Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.ZEV(switching transmitters) Echo Base... this is Rogue Two. I found them. Repeat, I found them.EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAYThe small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side. A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift. Han spots Zev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his arms frantically at the tiny craft.INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTERStrange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment. A switch is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank filled with a thick, gelatinous slime. He begins to thrash about, raving in delirium.INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER - RECOVERY ROOMLuke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling. His face shows terrible wounds from the Wampa's attack. Threepio and Artoo enter the room.THREEPIOMaster Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again.Artoo beeps his good wishes.THREEPIOArtoo expresses his relief, also.Han and Chewie make their entrance. The Wookiee growls a greeting.HANHow are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.LUKEThanks to you.HANThat's two you owe me, junior.Han turns as Leia enters the room. He looks at her with a big, devilish grin.HANWell your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around fora little while longer.LEIA(haughtily)I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.HANThat's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.LEIAI don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain.Chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner. Han, enjoying himself, regards Chewie good-humoredly.HANLaugh it up, fuzzball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage.Luke sparks to this; he looks at Leia.HANShe expressed her true feelings for me.Leia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han.LEIAMy...! Why, you stuck up,... half-witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-herder!HANWho's scruffy-looking? (to Luke) I must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?Leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls again, and she focuses on Luke.LEIAWhy, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?With that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips. Then she turns on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly dumbstruck. With some smugness, Luke puts his hands behind his head and grins.Suddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard.ANNOUNCER(over loudspeaker)Headquarters personnel, report to command center.The voice repeats the order and Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio hurry out of the room, bidding farewell to Luke.HANTake it easy.THREEPIOExcuse us, please.INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTERRieekan looks up grimly from a console screen. He calls over to Leia and Han.RIEEKANPrincess... we have a visitor.The group hurries over to Rieekan.RIEEKANWe've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east.SENIOR CONTROLLERIt's metal.LEIAThen it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.HANIt could be a speeder, one of ours.SENIOR CONTROLLERNo. Wait - there's something very weak coming through.Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the strange signal.THREEPIOSir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.The transmission ends in static.HANIt isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.RIEEKANSend Rogues Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DAYThe dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three-eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base. It raises a large antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing signal.The probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has popped his head over a snow bank. Instantly, the probe robot swings around, its deadly ray ready to fire. But before it can get a shot off, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million pieces.Han Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the smoldering remains of the Imperial probe.INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTERLeia and Rieekan listen to Han on the comlink.HAN(over comlink)Afraid there's not much left.LEIA(into comlink)What was it?HAN(over comlink)Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.LEIA(into comlink)An Imperial probe droid.HAN(over comlink)It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.RIEEKANWe'd better start the evacuation.EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEETDarth Vader's Star Destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of space. The six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller spacecraft. TIE fighters dart to and fro.INT. DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - MAIN CONTROL DECKControllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls. The squat, evil-looking Admiral Ozzel and the young, powerfully built General Veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the approaching presence and turn toward it. Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith, enters like a chill wind. As Vader moves across the wide bridge, Captain Piett hurries up to Ozzel.PIETTAdmiral.OZZELYes, CaptainPIETTI think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had.OZZEL(irritated) We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads!PIETTThe visuals indicate life readings.OZZELIt could mean anything.

General Veers enters the room and approaches the silent, unmoving Vader. Although seemingly very sure of himself, Veers is still not bold enough to interrupt the meditating lord. The younger general stands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks.VADERWhat is it, General?VEERSMy lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.VADER(angrily)The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system.VEERSHe felt surprise was wiser...VADERHe is as clumsy as he is stupid.General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.VEERSYes, my lord.Veers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large viewscreen showing the bridge of his mighty ship. Admiral Ozzel appears on the viewscreen, standing slightly in front of Captain Piett.OZZELLord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to... Aaagh!VADERYou have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett.Piett steps forward, as the admiral moves away, slightly confused, touching his throat as it begins to constrict painfully.PIETTYes, my lord.VADERMake ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett.PIETTThank you, Lord Vader.Piett's pleasure about his unexpected promotion is not an unmixed emotion. He glances warily at the struggling Admiral Ozzel who, with a final choke, stumbles and falls in a lifeless heap before him.INT.

A thin cable follows the projectile from the gun. The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull.Still running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his belt buckle. Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling underneath the walker.The walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen snow. Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch. Hanging precariously, Luke cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword.He takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the Imperial machine. Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto the icy ground far below. He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg passes by - and just misses him.The giant walker stops in mid-step. A muffled explosion comes from within - and then the walker's mechanical insides are spewed out every conceivable opening.

Watch this.Expectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into hyperspace, but just sit there.Han and Chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of concern.LEIAWatch what?Han tries again. Still nothing.HANI think we're in trouble.THREEPIOIf I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!HANWe're in trouble!The explosions become heavier.EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - STAR DESTROYERThe Falcon races into the starry vastness, followed by the four Imperial TIE fighters and an Imperial Star Destroyer.INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITStars race by as flak bursts outside the Falcon's window.INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLDHan works furiously at some control panels while giving various orders to Chewie.HANHorizontal boosters...!(Chewie barks)Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it.(Chewie barks)Bring me the hydrospanners!Chewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the edge.HANI don't know how we're going to get out of this one.Suddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch radically. Chewie barks. The tools fall into the pit on top of Han.HANOww! Chewie!More turbulence rocks the ship.HANThat was no laser blast! Something hit us.LEIA(over comlink)Han, get up here!HANCome on, Chewie!Han climbs out of the hold like a shot. Both he and Chewie run out of the hold and toward the cockpit.INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITOut the front cockpit window, they see hundreds of asteroids racing by.LEIAAsteroids!Han changes places with Leia who has been at the controls, and Chewie gets into his chair. Han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses in front of the ship.HANOh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.LEIAWhat are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?HANThey'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?Another asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at the jolt.LEIAYou don't have to do this to impress me.THREEPIOSir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.HANNever tell me the odds!EXT. ASTEROID BELT - MILLENNIUM FALCONThe Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows.A large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcon's path at top speed. Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small explosions on its surface. Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in every direction, some colliding and exploding. The tiny Millennium Falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain of rocks, followed by four TIE fighters, which bob and weave around the asteroids.One of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid and explodes. The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of smaller explosions.Two huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon, which quickly banks around both of them. The three TIE fighters follow in hot pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out of control into deep space.EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYER - ASTEROID BELTThe massive Star Destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the Falcon. Smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface.EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - ASTEROID BELTThe Falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid. Two TIE fighters follow in the distance, coming from either side.INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITAsteroids race by the cockpit window as Han pilots his trusty craft through the dangerous field.Looking out the cockpit window, the Falcon crew sees a big asteroid drop past the window, narrowly missing their ship.Chewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially close - to close - and bounces off the Falcon with a loud crunch. Threepio's hands cover his eyes. He manages a short peek at the cockpit window. Princess Leia sits stone-faced, staring at the action. Han gives her a quick look.HANYou said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart.LEIAI take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.The group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window.HANI'm not going to argue with that.THREEPIOPulverized?HANI'm going in closer to one of those big ones.LEIACloser?THREEPIOCloser?!Chewbacca barks the same word, only louder.EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID BELTThe Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized asteroids. There is a continued display of explosions against the starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock. The two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid. The Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while, small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship.The TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles directly into their path. As the asteroid continues on its way, it leaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to tumble into deep space.INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITRattled by the violent rocking of the starship, Threepio is nearly in hysterics.THREEPIOOh, this is suicide!Han notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful Wookiee, pointing.HANThere. That looks pretty good.LEIAWhat looks pretty good?HANYeah. That'll do nicely.THREEPIO(to Leia)Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?Out the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater.EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID CRATERThe Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears.INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITLEIAI hope you know what you're doing.HANYeah, me too.INT. GIANT ASTEROID CRATERThe Falcon races down into the crater. The walls are barely visible as the ship speed through the tunnellike opening. A small cave appears on one side of the crater, and the Falcon turns, slows, and scoots into it.EXT. SPACE - LUKE'S X-WINGThe tiny X-wing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah. Artoo, riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back and forth with some anxiety.INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPITLuke watches Artoo's words as they are translated and screened on the computer scope.LUKE(into comlink)Yes, that's it. Dagobah.Artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry.LUKE(into comlink)No, I'm not going to change my mind about this.(getting a little nervous)I'm not picking up any cities ortechnology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's somethingalive down there...Artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question.LUKE(into comlink)Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.EXT. SPACE - DAGOBAH - LUKE'S X-WINGThe X-wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud-covered planet.INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPITLuke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet. He must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has completely obscured his vision. An alarm buzzes in the background, Artoo beeps and whistles frantically.LUKE(into comlink)I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle...The blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out Artoo's electronic squeals. Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the spacecraft stops. Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.EXT. DAGOBAH - DUSKThe mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog. Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out of his cubbyhole on the back. The young warrior surveys the fog, which is barely pierced by the ship's landing lights. About all he can make out are some giant, twisted trees nearby. Artoo whistles anxiously.LUKENo, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around.Artoo lets out a short beep. As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.LUKEArtoo?Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.LUKEArtoo! Where are you?A small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is heard. The periscope starts to move to shore. Relieved, Luke starts running along the nose of the fighter to its tip.LUKEArtoo! You be more careful.The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.Luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and turns to look for Artoo. The periscope still steadily moves toward shore.LUKEArtoo - that way!Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving toward the little droid. The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull. The droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.LUKEArtoo!The black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin to appear. Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of soft gray moss.LUKEOh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken?Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from his round metal body. Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.LUKEIf you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy.As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him, Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.EXT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBERAdmiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private cubicle.After a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising sight before him.Darth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far side of the chamber. A black, insectlike droid attends him. Among the various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts from Vader's uncovered head. The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar tissue covering it. The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet onto Vader's head. When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face Piett.VADERYes, Admiral?PIETTOur ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But... it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk...VADER(interrupting)Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses.PIETTYes, lord.EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCONThe pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave. It is so dark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine.INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITHan and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems. Threepio and Leia watch worriedly.HANI'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems. THREEPIOSir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but... does that include shutting me down, too?Chewie barks "yes". But Han thinks otherwise.HANNo, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.Suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit to go flying. Chewie howls.THREEPIOSir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.HANNot entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.THREEPIOOh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...The sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he move back to the hold. Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia across the cabin into Han's arms. Then, abruptly, the motion stops as suddenly as it started. With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they are in each other's arms.LEIALet go.HANSshh!LEIALet go, please.Leia flushes, averting her eyes. She's not exactly fighting to get free. But, of course, Han blows it...HANDon't get excited.The anger rises in Leia.LEIACaptain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.HANSorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the door. Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSKThe mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking swamp.Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing. He ignites a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it. Taking a power cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket.LUKEReady for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go.The droid whistles his appreciation. Luke then opens a container of processed food and sits before the thermal heater.LUKE(sighs)Now all I have to do is find this Yoda... if he even exists.Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.LUKEStill... there's something familiar about this place. I feel like... I don't know...STRANGE VOICEFeel like what?Luke jumps out of his skin. Artoo screeches in terror. The young warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the speaker. Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, bluish creature, not more than two feet tall. The wizened little thing is dressed in rags. It motions toward Luke's sword.LUKE(looking at the creature)Like we're being watched!CREATUREAway with your weapon! I mean you no harm.After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really doesn't understand why. Artoo watches with interest.CREATUREI am wondering, why are you here?LUKEI'm looking for someone.CREATURELooking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?The little creature laughs.LUKE(Trying to keep from smiling)Right.CREATUREHelp you I can. Yes, mmmm.LUKEI don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.CREATUREAhhh! A great warrior.(laughs and shakes his head)Wars not make one great.With the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of the cases of supplies. He begins to rummage around.Artoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his disapproval.Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from and takes a bite.LUKEPut that down. Hey! That's my dinner!The creature spits out the bite he has taken. He makes a face.CREATUREHow you get so big, eating food of this kind?He flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of Luke's supply cases.LUKEListen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just...CREATURE(teasing)Aww, cannot get your ship out?The creature spots something of interest in Luke's case. Luke loses patience and grabs the case away. The creature retains his prize - a tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight.LUKEHey, you could have broken this.Don't do that. Ohhh... you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!CREATURE(retreating with the lamp)Mine! Or I will help you not.Clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing closer to Artoo. As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by the creature.LUKEI don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.CREATUREMudhole? Slimy? My home this is.Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately engaged in a tug-of-war over it.Artoo beeps a few angry, "Give me thats."CREATUREAh, ah, ah!LUKEOh, Artoo, let him have it!CREATUREMine! Mine!LUKEArtoo!CREATUREMine!The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one finger. Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go.CREATUREMine!LUKE(fed up)Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do.CREATURENo! No, no! Stay and help you, I will.(laughs)Find your friend, hmm?LUKEI'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.CREATUREOohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.LUKEYou know him?CREATUREMmm. Take you to him, I will.(laughs)Yes, yes. But now, we must eat.Come. Good food. Come.With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily. Luke stares after him. All he sees is the faint light from the small power lamp moving through the fog. Luke makes his decision and starts after the creature.CREATURE(in the distance)Come, come.Artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.LUKEStay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.Artoo beeps even more frantically. But as Luke disappears from view, the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic sigh.INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD AREAThreepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in front of him. The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps.THREEPIOOh, where is Artoo when I need him?Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.THREEPIOSir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.HANWell, of course I'll have to replace it.He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.HANHere! And Chewie...Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and whines. Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so only he can hear.HAN(continuing)... I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve. It doesn't budge. Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her. She rebuffs him.HANHey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.LEIA(still struggling)Would you please stop calling me that?Han hears a new tone in her voice. He watches her pull on the lever.HANSure, Leia.LEIAOh, you make it so difficult sometimes.HANI do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though.(he watches her reaction)Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.LEIAOccasionally...(a little smile, haltingly)... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.HAN(laughs)Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.With that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.LEIAStop that.HANStop what?Leia is flushes, confused.LEIAStop that! My hands are dirty.HANMy hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?LEIA(looking right into his eyes)Afraid?Han looks at her with a piercing look. He's never looked more handsome, more dashing, more confident. He reaches out slowly and takes Leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console. He draws it toward him.HANYou're trembling.LEIAI'm not trembling.Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him... very slowly.HANYou like me because I'm a scoundrel.There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.LEIAI happen to like nice men.HANI'm a nice man.LEIANo, you're not. You're...He kisses her now, with slow, hot lips. He takes his time, as though he had forever, bending her body backward. She has never been kissed like this before, and it almost makes her faint. When he stops, she regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it hard to talk.Suddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.THREEPIOSir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.Han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.HANThank you. Thank you very much.THREEPIOOh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.The moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio.EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELDThe Imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void, intently seeking its prey.INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGEAsteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge window. Darth Vader stands, staring out the window above the control deck. Then slowly turns toward the bridge. Before him are the hologram images of twenty battleship commanders. One of these images, the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly. Another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is faded and continually disrupted by static. It is the image of Captain Needa, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the Millennium Falcon. Admiral Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark Lord.NEEDA(in hologram)... and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed.VADERNo, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.The Imperial star captains fade out one by one as Vader turns to Admiral Piett.PIETTLord Vader.VADERYes, Admiral, what is it?The admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet.PIETTThe Emperor commands you make contact with him.VADERMove the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission.PIETTYes, my lord.EXT. ASTEROID FIELD - VADER'S STAR DESTROYERVader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars away from the rest of the fleet.INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBERThe Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber. A strange sound enters the room and a light begins to play across Vader's black figure. He looks up and bows quickly.A twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before Vader. The Emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are reminiscent of the cloak worn by Ben Kenobi. His voice is even deeper and more frightening than Vader's.VADERWhat is thy bidding, my master?EMPERORThere is a great disturbance in the Force.VADERI have felt it.EMPERORWe have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker.VADERYes, my master.EMPERORHe could destroy us.VADERHe's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.EMPERORThe Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.VADERIf he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.EMPERORYes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?VADERHe will join us or die, my master.Vader kneels. The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Lord of the Sith and fades away.EXT. DAGOBAH - CREATURE'S HOUSE - NIGHTA heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees. A strange baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small lagoon. The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its thick glass windows. As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head, the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of the glowing portals.INT. CREATURE'S HOUSEArtoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very plain, but cozy dwelling. Everything is in the same small scale as the creature. The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke, whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower. He sits cross-legged on the floor of the living room.The creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up an incredible meal. The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and pans. The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices. He rushes back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who watches the creature impatiently.LUKELook, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.CREATUREPatience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?Moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke sits down near the fire and serves himself from the pot. Tasting the unfamiliar concoction, he is pleasantly surprised.LUKEHow far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?CREATURENot far. Yoda not far. Patience.Soon you will be with him.(tasting food from the pot)Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?LUKEMostly because of my father, I guess.CREATUREAh, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.LUKE(a little angry)Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.(fed up)Oh, I don't know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time.The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party.CREATURE(irritated)I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.Luke's head spins in the direction the creature faces. But there is no one there. The boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that the little creature is Yoda, the Jedi Master, and that he is speaking with Ben.BEN'S VOICEHe will learn patience.YODAHmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.BEN'S VOICEWas I any different when you taught me?YODAHah. He is not ready.LUKEYoda! I am ready. I... Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready.Trying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low ceiling.YODAReady, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained!A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.(to the invisible Ben, indicating Luke)This one a long time have I watched.All his life has he looked away...to the future, to the horizon.Never his mind on where he was.Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things.(turning to Luke)You are reckless!Luke looks down. He knows it is true.BEN'S VOICESo was I, if you'll remember.YODAHe is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.Luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yoda's voice.LUKEBut I've learned so much.Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master's huge eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned. After a long moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben.YODA(sighs)Will he finished what he begins?LUKEI won't fail you - I'm not afraid.YODA(turns slowly toward him)Oh, you will be. You will be.EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYERS - ASTEROID FIELDThe Imperial fleet around Vader's ship is surrounded by the asteroid storm. Asteroids big and small pelt the vast exteriors of the menacing ships. One of the smaller Imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid and explodes in a brilliant flash of light.INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITThe cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the control panel. Princess Leia sits in the pilot's seat.She runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han and the confusion he has created within her. Suddenly, something outside the cockpit window catches her eye. The reflection of the panel lights obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the windscreen. Leiamoves closer to see what it might be. Large, yellow eyes flash open and stare back at her. Startled, she jumps back into her seat, her heart pounding. There is a scurry of feet and a loud screech, and in an instant the eyes are gone. The young princess catches her breath, jumps out of her chair, and races from the cockpit.INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREAThe lights go bright for a second then out again. Threepio and Chewbacca watch as Han finishes with some wires.THREEPIOSir, if I may venture an opinion...HANI'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.Leia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final floor panel into place.LEIA(out of breath)There's something out there.HANWhere?LEIAOutside, in the cave.As she speaks, there comes a sharp banging on the hull. Chewie looks up and barks anxiously.THREEPIOThere it is. Listen! Listen!HANI'm going out there.LEIAAre you crazy?!HANI just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart.He and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out. Leia follows.LEIAThen I'm going with you.THREEPIOI think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship.(hears another mysterious noise)Oh, no.EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCONIt is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is attacking the ship.Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.LEIAThis ground sure feels strange.It doesn't feel like rock at all.Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline of the cave.HANThere's an awful lot of moisture in here.LEIAI don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.HANYeah.Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's cockpit. A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of the Falcon. The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it with a laser bolt.HAN(to Leia)Watch out!The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front of the princess. Han bends down to investigate the dead creature.HANYeah, that's what I thought.Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables.LEIAMynocks?HANGo on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air. Leia puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the ship. Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster. Several of the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit window of the Falcon. Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence.THREEPIOOhhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly little thing. Shoo! Shoo!Han looks around the strange, dripping cave.HANWait a minute...He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave. The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle.Chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han. The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their faces and run up the platform.INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ENTRY AREAAs soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the main hatch. The ship continues to shake and heave.HANAll right, Chewie, let's get out of here!The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel. Leia hurries after.LEIAThe Empire is still out there.I don't think it's wise to...Han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit.HAN(interrupting)No time to discuss this incommittee.And with that he is gone. The main engines of the Falcon begin to whine. Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship.LEIA(angry)I am not a committee!INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITHan is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the throttle. The cave-quake has greatly diminished.LEIAYou can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...HANSit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!As the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks. He notices something out the window ahead. Threepio sees it too.THREEPIOLook!HANI see it, I see it.Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen surrounding the entrance. And as the Falcon moves forward, the entrance to the cave grows ever smaller. Han pulls hard on the throttle, sending his ship surging forward.THREEPIOWe're doomed!LEIAThe cave is collapsing.HANThis is no cave.LEIAWhat?Leia's mouth drops open . She sees that the rocks of the cave entrance are not rocks at all, but giant teeth, quickly closing around the tiny ship. Chewie howls.INT. SPACE SLUG MOUTHThe Millennium Falcon, zooming through the monster's mouth, rolls on its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth before the huge jaws slams closed.EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - GIANT ASTEROIDThe enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the Falcon flies out of its mouth. The monster tilts its head, watching the starship fly away.EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROIDThe Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of the asteroid storm.EXT. DAGOBAH - DAYWith Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick vines that grow in the swamp. Panting heavily, he continues his course - climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in and out of the heavy ground fog.YODARun! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger... fear... aggression. The dark side of the Force are they.Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.LUKEVader. Is the dark side stronger?YODANo... no... no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.LUKEBut how am I to know the good side from the bad?YODAYou will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.LUKEBut tell me why I can't...YODA(interrupting)No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today.Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmmmm.Artoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground. Breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and pulls it on.He turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few feet of water. Giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on one side. Luke stares at the tree, trembling.LUKEThere's something not right here.Yoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt.LUKEI feel cold, death.YODAThat place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.LUKEWhat's in there?YODAOnly what you take with you.Luke looks warily between the tree and Yoda. He starts to strap on his weapon belt.YODAYour weapons... you will not need them.Luke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head "no." Yoda shrugs. Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters the tree.INT. DAGOBAH - TREE CAVELuke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave. The youth can barely make out the edge of the passage. Holding his lit saber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree. Luke draws a deep breath, then pushes deeper into the cave.The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it. His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness. It is very quiet here.Then, a loud HISS! Darth Vader appears across the blackness, illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword. Immediately, he charges Luke, saber held high. He is upon the youth in seconds, but Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword.Vader is decapitated. His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders as his body disappears into the darkness. The metallic banging of the helmet fills the cave as Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the floor, and finally stops. For an instant it rests on the floor, then it cracks vertically. The black helmet and breath mask fall away to reveal... Luke's head.Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in terror.The decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.EXT. DAGOBAH - CAVE - DUSKMeanwhile, Yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his Gimer Stick.EXT.

VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - CONTROL DECKVader stands in the back control area of his ship's bridge with a motley group of men and creatures. Admiral Piett and two controllers stand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn.PIETTBounty hunters. We don't need that scum.FIRST CONTROLLERYes, sir.PIETTThose Rebels won't escape us.A second controller interrupts.SECOND CONTROLLERSir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger.PIETTRight.The group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune hunters There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge, bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle-scarred, mangy human types; IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war droid; and Boba Fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit.VADER... there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations.BOBA FETTAs you wish.At that moment, Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of excitement.PIETTLord Vader! My lord, we have them.EXT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID BELTThe Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a firing Imperial Star Destroyer. A large asteroid about the same size as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship. The tiny Falcon banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface. Then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly on the hull of the vast Star Destroyer.INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITThe ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window. Threepio checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while Leia watches tensely out the window.THREEPIOOh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field.Chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside. A bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch to one side.EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID FIELDThe Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship. The Falcon tilts steeply, then rights itself.INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITHan corrects the angle of his ship.HANLet's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One... two... three!Han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens. Flak bursts continue to rock the ship.HAN(frantic)It's not fair!Chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and captain. Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle.HANThe transfer circuits are working.It's not my fault!Chewie puts his head in his hands, whining.LEIA(almost expecting it)No light-speed?HANIt's not my fault.THREEPIOSir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.Han pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever.HANTurn her around.Chewie barks in puzzlement.HANI said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield.LEIAYou're going to attack them?!THREEPIOSir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer...LEIAShut up!EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID FIELDThe Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn. In the next moment it is racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking very small against the massive surface of the Imperial ship. As it moves across the surface of the Star Destroyer, the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous flak bursts.INT. STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - BRIDGEThe tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avenger's bridge. The Imperials stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low across the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge area. Alarms go off everywhere. The Destroyer's commander, Captain Needa, can scarcely believe his eyes.NEEDAThey're moving to attack position! Shields up!Needa and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge window. At the last minute, the Falcon veers off and out of sight. All is quiet.NEEDATrack them. They may come around for another pass.TRACKING OFFICERCaptain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes.NEEDAThey can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device.TRACKING OFFICERWell, there's no trace of them, sir.COMMUNICATIONS OFFICERCaptain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit.NEEDA(drawing a breath)Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.COMMUNICATIONS OFFICERYes, Captain Needa.EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DAYLuke's face is upside-down and showing enormous strain. He stands on his hands, with Yoda perched on his feet. Opposite Luke and Yoda are two rocks the size of bowling balls. Luke stares at the rocks and concentrates. One of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to rest on the other.YODAUse the Force. Yes...Yoda taps Luke's leg. Quickly, Luke lifts one hand from the ground. His body wavers, but he maintains his balance. Artoo, standing nearby, is whistling and beeping frantically.YODANow... the stone. Feel it.Luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock. It rises a few feet, shaking under the strain. But, distracted by Artoo's frantic beeping, Luke loses his balance and finally collapses. Yoda jumps clear.YODAConcentrate!Annoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who is rocking urgently back and forth in front of him.Artoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots over the edge of the swamp. Catching on, Luke rushes to the water's edge. The X-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of its nose shows above the lake's surface.LUKEOh, no. We'll never get it out now.Yoda stamps his foot in irritation.YODASo certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear younothing that I say?Luke looks uncertainly out at the ship.LUKEMaster, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different.YODANo! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.LUKE(focusing, quietly)All right, I'll give it a try.YODANo! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.Luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out.Slowly, the X-wing's nose begins to rise above the water. It hovers for a moment and then slides back, disappearing once again.LUKE(panting heavily)I can't. It's too big.YODASize matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm.Luke shakes his head.YODAAnd well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we...(Yoda pinches Luke's shoulder)... not this crude matter.(a sweeping gesture)You must feel the Force around you.(gesturing)Here, between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!LUKE(discouraged)You want the impossible.Quietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter. With his eyes closed and his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship.Soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo beeps in terror and scoots away.The entire X-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the shore. Yoda stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the beach.Luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore. He walks toward Yoda.LUKEI don't... I don't believe it.YODAThat is why you fail.Luke shakes his head, bewildered.EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEETThe fleet around Vader's Star Destroyer now includes Needa's Star Destroyer, the Avenger.INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGEVADERApology accepted, Captain Needa.Clutching desperately at his throat, Captain Needa slumps down, then falls over on his back, at the feet of Darth Vader. Two stormtroopers pick up the lifeless body and carry it quickly away as Admiral Piett and two of his captains hurry up to the Dark Lord.PIETTLord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.

MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITTHREEPIOCaptain Solo, this time you have gone too far.(Chewie growls)No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.Why doesn't anyone listen to me?HAN(to Chewie)The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.Chewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin.THREEPIOI really don't see how that is going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...Leia reaches over and shuts off Threepio, mid-sentence.HANThank you.LEIAWhat did you have in mind for your next move?HANWell, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.LEIAWith the rest of the garbage.Then what?HANThen we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?LEIANo. Where are we?HANThe Anoat system.LEIAAnoat system. There's not much there.HANNo. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.He points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel. Leia slips out of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot. Small light points representing several systems flash by on the computer screen.LEIALando system?HANLando's not a system, he's a man.Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.LEIAThanks.HANBespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.LEIA(reading from the computer)A mining colony?HANYeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me.LEIACan you trust him?HANNo. But he has no love for theEmpire, I can tell you that.Chewie barks over the intercom. Han quickly changes his readouts and stretches to look out the cockpit window.HAN(into intercom)Here we go, Chewie. Stand by.Detach!Han leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible smile. She thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and she gives him a quick kiss.LEIAYou do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYERAs the Avenger Star Destroyer moves slowly into space, the hatch on its underbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind it. Hidden among the refuse, the Falcon tumbles away. In the next moment, the Avenger roars off into hyperspace. The Falcon's engines are ignited, and it races off into the distance. Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett's ship appears and moves after the Falcon.EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - CLEARING - DAYIn the clearing behind Yoda's house, Luke again stands upside-down, but his face shows less strain and more concentration than before. Yoda sits on the ground below the young warrior. On the other side of the clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air. Nearby Artoo watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air. His little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically, looking for help.YODAConcentrate... feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future... the past. Old friends long gone.Luke suddenly becomes distressed.LUKEHan! Leia!The two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then Luke himself tumbles over.YODA(shaking his head)Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.LUKEI saw... I saw a city in the clouds.YODAMmm. Friends you have there.LUKEThey were in pain.YODAIt is the future you see.LUKEFuture? Will they die?Yoda closes his eyes and lowers his head.YODADifficult to see. Always in motion is the future.LUKEI've got to go to them.YODADecide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could.

I'm responsible these days.It's the price you pay for being successful.Han and Lando laugh together, and the group moves on through the corridor.The lagging Threepio passes a Threepio-type silver droid who is coming out of a door.THREEPIOOh!

Her hair is down, tied back with ribbons. She moves from a large, open window and turns to see Han entering through the doorway.HANThe ship is almost finished.Two or Three more things and we're in great shape.LEIAThe sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio.He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.Han takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead.HANRelax.

Four Ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten metal. Pieces of Threepio's golden body move down the belt. Chewie enters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting Threepio's head. The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught, then reaches to grab the head. But the Ugnaught tosses it away from him to another Ugnaught. This game of keep-away goes on until Threepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the ground.INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAYThe door zaps open. Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of Threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge.LEIAWhat happened?Chewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation.HANWhere?

Standing at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty hunter.Faster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a couple of shots directly at Vader. The Dark Lord quickly raises his hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they explode harmlessly. Just as quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's hand. The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of him.VADERWe would be honored if you would join us.Han gives Lando a mean look.LANDOI had no choice. They arrived right before you did.

CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELLChewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell. The stark room is flooded with hot light. To add to Chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle screeches loudly. Chewie is going mad. He hits the wall with giant fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor. The upper lights go off abruptly. The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a wall, where he listens for a moment. Then, moaning to himself, he moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie. He picks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment, barking a few philosophical remarks. Chewie sticks the robot's head on its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.Suddenly, the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches two connectors together. Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.THREEPIOMmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no... Please don't get up. No!Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry head. He gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon Threepio immediately begins speaking normally.THREEPIOStormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others.Oh, no! I've been shot!INT. CLOUD CITY - PRISON ENTRY AREADarth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an elaborate torture mechanism. Han is strapped to a rack which tilts forward onto the torture device. Vader activates the mechanism, creating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes Han's face.The door opens, and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a sharp, piercing cry of agony. Darth Vader moves to the holding chamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him.INT. CLOUD CITY - HOLDING CHAMBERLANDOLord Vader.VADER(to Fett)You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker.Han's screams filter through the torture room door.BOBA FETTHe's no good to me dead.VADERHe will not be permanently damaged.LANDOLord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?VADERThey must never again leave this city.LANDOThat was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!VADERPerhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.LANDONo.VADERGood. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.Vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett. Lando walks swiftly down another corridor, muttering to himself.LANDOThis deal's getting worse all the time.INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELLChewie now has a little more of Threepio back together. One arm is connected, but the legs are yet to be attached. There is one small problem, however. It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droid's head on backwards.THREEPIOOh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a circuit and the droid shuts down. The Wookiee smells something and sits up. The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is shoved into the room by two stormtroopers. Barking his concern, the huge Wookiee gives Han a big hug. Han is very pale, with dark circles under his eyes.HANI feel terrible.Chewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open revealing Leia. She, too, looks a little worse for wear. The troopers push her into the cell, and the door slides closed. She moves to Han, who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking his head.LEIAWhy are they doing this?HANThey never even asked me any questions.The cell door slides open. Lando and two of his guards enter.LEIALando.HANGet out of here, Lando!LANDOShut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.HANOver to you?LANDOThey'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.LEIAWhat about Han?LANDOVader's giving him to the bounty hunter.LEIAVader wants us all dead.LANDOHe doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.HANLuke?LANDOLord Vader has set a trap for him.Leia's mind is racing.LEIAAnd we're the bait.LANDOWell, he's on his way.Han's rage peaks.HANPerfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?(spits it out)My friend!Han hauls off and punches Lando. The two friends are instantly engaged in a frantic close-quarters fight. The guards hit Han with their rifle butts and he flies across the room. Chewie growls and starts for the guards. They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando stops them.LANDOStop! I've done all I can. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems.HANYeah, you're a real hero.Lando and the guards leave. Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia and Chewie help him up.LEIA(dabs at his wound)You certainly have a way with people.INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBERFour armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large chamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks. In the middle of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform. Darth Vader and Lando stand near the platform.VADERThis facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.An Imperial soldier appears.IMPERIAL SOLDIERLord Vader, ship approaching.X-wing class.VADERGood. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.The soldier bows and leaves the chamber.LANDOLord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him.VADERI do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it... on Captain Solo.Lando's face registers dismay.EXT. SPACE - BESPIN SYSTEM - LUKE'S X-WINGLuke's X-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city.INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPITEncountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel with concern.INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBERThere is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform. Six Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use. A special coffinlike container is put in place. With Boba Fett in the lead, a squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie. Strapped to Chewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is Threepio. Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see what is happening. His one attached arm is animate and expressive, intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes. The remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.THREEPIOIf only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.HAN(to Lando)What's going on... buddy?LANDOYou're being put into carbon freeze.Boba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.BOBA FETTWhat if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.VADERThe Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!Realizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and attacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han. Within seconds, other Imperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee with their laser weapons.From the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.THREEPIOOh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!The stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.HANStop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!THREEPIOYes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.Han breaks away from his captors. Vader nods to the guards to let him go and the pirate breaks up the fight.HANChewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!Han gives the Wookiee a stern look.HANSave your strength. There'll be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. You hear me?Han winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too distraught to protest. Han turns to Princess Leia. They look sorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a final, passionate kiss.LEIAI love you!HANI know.Tears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to the hydraulic platform. Han looks one final time at his friends - and then, suddenly, the platform drops. Chewie howls. Leia turns away in agony.Lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.Instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and fluid as great as any steel furnace. Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.THREEPIOWhat... what's going on? Turn round, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh... they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is.Chewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an angry glance and bark.A huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate out of the vat and stands him on the platform. Some Ugnaughts rush over and push the block over onto the platform. They slide the coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it inside. They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step away. Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat. He shakes his head in relief.VADERWell, Calrissian, did he survive?LANDOYes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.Vader turns to Boba Fett.VADERHe's all yours bounty hunter.Reset the chamber for Skywalker.IMPERIAL OFFICERSkywalker has just landed, my lord.VADERGood. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.LANDOYou said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.VADERI am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.Lando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia, Chewie, and Threepio.INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAYAs Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a group of people coming down a side hallway. Artoo lets out an excited series of beeps and whistles. Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops in his tracks with a feeble squeak.Boba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the floating, encased body of Han Solo. Two stormtroopers, who follow, immediately spot Luke and open fire on him. The youth draws his weapon and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot. The two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a huge chunk of wall.Luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett, Han, and the guards are gone. A think metal door blocks the passage. Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a second hallway by several other stormtroopers. Leia turns just in time to see Luke.LEIALuke! Luke, don't - it's a trap! It's a trap!Before she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears from sight. Luke races after the group, leaving little Artoo trailing behind.INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOMLuke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings. Leia and the others are nowhere to be seen. Behind Luke, Artoo scoots down the corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes slamming down, cutting off Luke's exit. Several more doors clang shut, echoing through the chamber.INT. CLOUD CITY - HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOMArtoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door. He whistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed, wanders off in the other direction.INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - ANTEROOMLuke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam. Seeing an opening above him, he stops to look up. As he does, the platform he stands on begins to move.INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBERLuke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform. The room is deathly quiet. Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else seems to be in the large room. Warily, Luke walks toward the stairway.Steam begins to build up in the chamber. Looking up through the steam, Luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him. Luke holsters his gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader. He feels confident, eager to engage his enemy.VADERThe Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet.Luke ignites his sword in answer. In an instant, Vader's own sword is lit. Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow. Again Luke attacks, and the swords of the two combatants clash in battle.INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDORLeia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along, guarded by six stormtroopers. The group reaches an intersection where Lobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention.The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers. Taking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia and one to Lando.LANDOWell done. Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet. Move.As Lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, Lando begins to undo Chewie's binding.LEIAWhat do you think you're doing?LANDOWe're getting out of here.THREEPIOI knew all along it had to be a mistake.Chewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him.LEIADo you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you?Lando tries to free himself from Chewie.LANDO(choking)I had no choice...Chewie barks ferociously.THREEPIO(to Chewie)What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!LEIAOh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.LANDOI'm just trying to help...LEIAWe don't need any of your help.LANDO(choking)H-a-a-a...LEIAWhat?THREEPIOIt sounds like Han.LANDOThere's still a chance to save Han... I mean, at the East Platform...LEIAChewie.Chewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath back.THREEPIO(to Lando)I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.EXT. CLOUD CITY - EAST LANDING PLATFORM - BOBA FETT'S SHIPThe two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in the side of the bounty hunter's ship. Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to the cargo hold.BOBA FETTPut Captain Solo in the cargo hold.And with that, the door slams shut.INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDORLando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly they spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly.THREEPIOArtoo! Artoo! Where have you been?Chewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio to be spun out of sight of his friend.THREEPIOTurn around, you wooly...! (to Artoo)Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!Whistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with the racing group.THREEPIOWell, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me!EXT. EAST LANDING PLATFORM - SIDE BAYAn elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform.Just as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset sky. In wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship.THREEPIOOh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!A laser bolt explodes near the princess. Everyone turns to see what Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad of stormtroopers running toward them. Artoo peeks out from the elevator.Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break for the elevator. Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge. Lando sticks his head out of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely notice. They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.But after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser fire toward the elevator. Once they are inside, the door slams shut and the stormtroopers race forward.INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBERLuke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the chamber. Their swords clash, the platform sways. Luke aggressively drives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics.VADERYou have learned much, young one.LUKEYou'll find I'm full of surprises.Vader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and sending it flying. Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the youth to jump back to protect himself. Losing his balance, Luke rolls down the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform. There he sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken. Just in time he looks up to see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him. Luke rolls away as Vader lands. Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his enemy.VADERYour destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true.LUKENo!Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly. All the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.Suddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and falls back into the opening. There is a rumble, and in an instant freezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision. Vader turns aside and deactivates his sword.VADERAll to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought.Through the steam behind Vader something blurs upward. Liquid metal begins to pour into the pit.Vader turns around - and then looks up. He sees Luke, who has leaped fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the carbonite outlet.VADERImpressive... most impressive.Luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the steaming carbonite pit. He raises his hand. His sword, which had fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his outstretched hand and is instantly ignited. Vader immediately lights his sword as well.VADERObi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger.Luke is more cautious, controlling his anger. He begins to retreat as Vader goads him on. As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he has been foolhardy. A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back. Another exchange and Vader retreats. Luke presses forward.VADEROnly your hatred can destroy me.Breathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader. He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to fill up with steam.Vader retreats before Luke's skillful sword. Vader blocks the sword, but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes. The energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of collapse. Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of Vader. He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers himself into the pit.INT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOMMoving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the reactor room. He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward a large window as Vader enters.Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall and comes smashing forward toward his back. Luke turns and cuts it in half just as another machine comes hurtling at him. Using the Force, Luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an invisible shield.A large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke. He deflects it. Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth. Small tools and equipment come flying at him. Bombardment from all sides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is bloodied and bruised. Finally, one machine glances off his and goes flying out the large window. A fierce wind blows into the room, unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.A piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window.INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFTLuke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his deactivated sword in hand. He puts the sword on his belt and begins to scramble up.INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORMLeia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the door to the landing platform. They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a moment before the door slams shut. The group ducks into an alcove as stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor. The troopers send a rain of laser bolts at the group. Chewie returns their fire as Lando punches desperately at the door's control panel.LANDOThe security codes has been changed!THREEPIOArtoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system.Threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel. Artoo beeps and scoots toward it. Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel's intercom.LANDOAttention! This is LandoCalrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.Artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the socket. Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream. Artoo's circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out underneath him. Quickly, Chewie pulls him away.LANDOThis way.Lando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor. As he scoots along with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio's way.THREEPIODon't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDORIn a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city. Some carry boxes, others packages. They run, then change direction. Some are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide.Other stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back at them. Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while Threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude.THREEPIOWhat are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.Chewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor. A triumphant beep from Artoo - and the door snaps open.THREEPIO(to Artoo)I never doubted you for a second.Wonderful!Artoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes outside.EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - CLOUD CITY - DUSKThey race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers reaches the main door. Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the droids get on board with Chewie. As Chewie bounds to the ship the Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp.THREEPIOOuch! Oh! Ah! That hurt. Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!Chewie starts up the ship. The giant engines begin to whine as Lando and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire.LANDOLeia! Go!INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDORArtoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the Falcon.THREEPIOI thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.Artoo beeps understandingly.INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITChewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han's seat and Lando watches over their shoulders. As Chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship begins to move.EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - DUSKThe Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars away from the city. Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in pursuit.INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFTLuke moves along the railing and up to the control room.Vader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet Vader's. Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke backward toward the gantry.VADERYou are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.Luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder. The black armor sparks and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers.Luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at him, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword. Luke makes a quick move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry. Vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward.Luke glances at the instrument complex floating away. At that instant, Vader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his hand and sending his sword flying. In great pain, Luke squeezes his forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its extreme end. Vaderfollows. The wind subsides. Luke holds on. There is nowhere else to go. VADERThere is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover your power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.LUKEI'll never join you!VADERIf you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.LUKEHe told me enough! It was you who killed him.VADERNo. I am your father.Shocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief.LUKENo. No. That's not true! That's impossible!VADERSearch your feelings. You know it to be true.LUKENo! No! No!VADERLuke. You can destroy the Emperor.He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It is the only way.Vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.A calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision. In the next instant he steps off the gantry platform into space. The Dark Lord looks over the platform and sees Luke falling far below. The wind begins to blow at Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the edge. The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast, unable to grab onto anything to break his fall.INT. REACTOR SHAFTSuddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft. When Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform.INT. EXHAUST PIPELuke tumbles through the exhaust pipe.He slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet hit a circular grill and knock it open. Luke claws at the surface of the pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space.EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE - DUSKUnable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the undermost part of Cloud City. Reaching out desperately, he manages to grab onto on electronic weather vane.LUKEBen... Ben, please!Luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down. He hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments. All the while, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust pipe.LUKEBen. Leia!There is an ominous cracking sound from the base of theweather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below.LUKEHear me! Leia!INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITLeia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled. Chewie is busy operating the ship. Lando stands next to the Wookiee, watching a readout on the control panel.LEIALuke...

BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANELuke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane. He slips from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks toward him. The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up through the opening of the hatch. Luke begins to slide and finally falls from the vane into space.INT.

The sound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up. Faces are tense, expectant. But nothing happens, and the engine goes off. Chewie lets out a frustrated howl. The flak still violently rocks the ship.LANDOThey told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault!Chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit.

Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...PAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive superstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small, green moon of ENDOR.An Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored space station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the Death Star.2 INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT The shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.SHUTTLE CAPTAINCommand station, this is ST 321.

A squad of Imperial stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.4 INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAYThe DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat, strides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp. The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival. But the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall.The exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only darkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this black void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH.

We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before catching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along the road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt.THREEPIOOf course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.Artoo whistles timidly.THREEPIODon't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.The two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.THREEPIOArtoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.6 EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE Threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly knocks on the iron door.THREEPIO (instantly) There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.A small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects the two droids.STRANGE VOICETee chuta hhat yudd!THREEPIOGoodness gracious me! Threepio points to Artoo, then to himself. THREEPIO Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.The eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the eye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his concern.THREEPIOI don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.Artoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at one another, afraid to enter.Artoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby companion. The door lowers noisily behind them.THREEPIO Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this.Artoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.THREEPIOOh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me!7 INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAYThe door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark passageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN GUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances quickly back at the two lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One guard grunts an order. Artoo beeps nervously.THREEPIOJust you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.Walking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.BIBDie Wanna Wanga!THREEPIOOh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.Artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.THREEPIO (cont)...and a gift.(thinks a moment, then to Artoo)Gift, what gift?Bib shakes his head negatively.BIBNee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.Bib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit, letting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to the strange-looking alien.THREEPIOHe says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.Bib thinks about this for a moment.THREEPIOI'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.Bib gestures for the droids to follow.BIBNudd Chaa.The droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed by the two guards.THREEPIOArtoo, I have a bad feeling about this.8 INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOMThe throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES ever conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the room to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a repulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the horrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At the foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS CRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba laughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows politely.THREEPIOGood morning.JABBABo Shuda!The robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned villain.THREEPIOThe message, Artoo, the message.Artoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head, creating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.LUKEGreetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids.Threepio is startled by this announcement.THREEPIOWhat did he say?LUKE (cont)... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.THREEPIOThis can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.Luke's hologram disappears.Jabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)There will be no bargain.THREEPIOWe're doomed.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.Jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne. Hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a carbonized HAN SOLO.THREEPIOArtoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.9 INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR One of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank, shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable creatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm or tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps pitifully.THREEPIOWhat could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!A large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break free, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.10 INT BOILER ROOMThe door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy machinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are met by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9. Behind the robot can be seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work droid. A second power droid is upside down. As smoking branding irons are pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized electronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts to EV-9D9.NINEDENINEAh, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?THREEPIOI am See-Threepio, human-cy...NINEDENINEYes or no will do.THREEPIOOh. Well, yes.NINEDENINEHow many languages do you speak?THREEPIOI am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...NINEDENINESplendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.THREEPIODisintegrated?NINEDENINE (to a Gamorrean guard)Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.The guard shoves Threepio toward the door.THREEPIO (disappearing)Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!Artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps angrily.NINEDENINEYou're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely.The poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured electronic scream.11 INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOMThe court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous party. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a fat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.Jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons Oola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away, shaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him.JABBADa Eitha!The lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.OOLANa Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...Jabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.JABBABoscka!He pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the floor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous friends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her fate through a grate.Threepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of Han Solo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen. An unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the room, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two guards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his captive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.Bib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into his ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens intently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a greeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).BOUSHH (in Ubese subtitled)I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.THREEPIOOh, no! Chewbacca!JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.Jabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to Threepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.THREEPIOOh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!Jabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh listens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices BOBA FETT standing near the door.THREEPIOOh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand.BOUSHH (in Ubese subtitled)I want fifty thousand. No less.Jabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his weapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the throne. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.THREEPIOUh, oh... but what, what did I say?(to Boushh)Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.The bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio looks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.THREEPIOBecause he's holding a thermal detonator.The guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across his vast mouth and he begins to laugh.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.Jabba continues.THREEPIOJabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.Bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his reaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes dead.BOUSHHZeebuss.THREEPIOHe agrees!The raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca growls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly appreciative creatures.Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.12 INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELLGamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When a tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror. It takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming the door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the iron door.13 EXT JABBA'S PALACEThe palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in front, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert rodent and burps in satisfaction.14 INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHTSilence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.A shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of the room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his way carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.Han Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his coffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of the coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.Boushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to the controls on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches and, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides the de-carbonization lever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the contours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches as Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands, previously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His face muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.Boushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath of life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he begins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.BOUSHHJust relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.Han touches his face with his hand and moans.BOUSHHShhh. You have hibernation sickness.HANI can't see.BOUSHHYour eyesight will return in time.HANWhere am I?BOUSHHJabba's palace.HANWho are you?The bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head, revealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.LEIASomeone who loves you.HANLeia!LEIAI gotta get you out of here.As Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is pierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of the alcove.HANWhat's that? I know that laugh.The curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the Hutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.HANHey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.Jabba laughs.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder.HANLook...JABBA (cont Huttese subtitled)Take him away!The guards grab Han and start to lead him away.HANJabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!Han is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead Leia away.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)Bring her to me.Jabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young princess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly turns away in disgust.LEIAWe have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)I'm sure.Inexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of Jabba's ugly blob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.LEIAUgh!THREEPIOOhhh, I can't bear to watch.15 INT DUNGEON CELLThe heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. A guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door slams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack in the door. Han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is heard from the far side of the cell. He jumps back against the cell door and listens.HANChewie? Chewie, is that you?The shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light, revealing Chewie.HANAh! Chew--Chewie!The giant Wookiee barks with glee.HANWait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?Chewie barks an excited blue streak.HANLuke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody.Chewie barks a reply.HANA...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur.Chewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.HANI'm all right, pal. I'm all right.16 INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACENoisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT and reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a robe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke strides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block Luke's path. Luke halts.Luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately lower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and moves on down the hallway.Bib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they approach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his direction and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the conversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.LUKEI must speak with Jabba.Bib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and stares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.LUKEYou will take me to Jabba now!Bib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him into the gloom.LUKEYou serve your master well.Bib responds.LUKEAnd you will be rewarded.17 INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOMJabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him. Salacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a manacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt. Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.THREEPIOAt last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.BIBMaster.Jabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.BIB...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)I told you not to admit him.LUKEI must be allowed to speak.BIB (in Huttese subtitled)He must be allowed to speak.Jabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.Luke stares hard at Jabba.LUKEYou will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.LUKENevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.Jabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about the pit.THREEPIOMaster Luke, you're standing on...JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.Luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies into Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his hand.JABBABascka!The floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into the pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba laughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained by a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at him and he shakes his head "no."18 INT RANCOR PITLuke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the dungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically for help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in the side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic. Luke looks calmly around for a means of escape.THREEPIOOh, no! The Rancor!At the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers and laughs at the guard's fate.The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in rage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an avalanche.The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the holding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility door--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into the crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it down on the Rancor's finger.19 HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PITThe Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding cave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he succeeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond the gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the monster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The guards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears, laughing.Luke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for him. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall. As the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the cave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes crashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on an egg.A startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation at this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning red with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh commands to his guards and they hurry off.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.21 INT RANCOR PITThe Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining their dead beast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other glares menacingly at Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush into the holding tunnel and take Luke away.22 INT THRONE ROOMThe crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought into the throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.LUKEHan!HANLuke!LUKEAre you all right?HANFine. Together again, huh?LUKEWouldn't miss it.HANHow are we doing?LUKEThe same as always.HANThat bad, huh? Where's Leia?Luke looks to Leia.LEIAI'm here.Threepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes Leia like a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from the other side of the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba.Threepio steps forward and translates for the captives.THREEPIOOh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.HANGood, I hate long waits.THREEPIOYou will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.HAN (to Luke)Doesn't sound so bad.THREEPIOIn his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.HANOn second thought, let's pass on that, huh?Chewie barks his agreement.LUKEYou should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.Jabba cackles evilly at this.As the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer rises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but Luke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.23 EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFFJabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by two smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke, Han, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is Lando in disguise.HANI think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.LUKEThere's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.HANYou're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.LUKEJust stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.HANOh... great!24 INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECKJabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time. Leia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to her neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to him.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)Soon you will learn to appreciate me.Threepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.THREEPIOOh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?Artoo beeps a quick reply.THREEPIOWell, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!Artoo whistles a singsong response.THREEPIOHmm. I wish I had your confidence.25 EXT SARLACC PIT The convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is extended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.26 EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECKJabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps up to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across loudspeakers.THREEPIOVictims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.27 EXT SKIFFHan steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.HANThreepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?Chewie growls his agreement.LUKEJabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.Lando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look of conspiracy to him.28 INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECKThe assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips unnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as he speaks into the comlink.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)Move him into position.Jabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.29 EXT BARGE - UPPER DECKArtoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit. Below, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the plank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap opens in Artoo's domed head.JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)Put him in.30 EXT SKIFF - PLANKLuke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the bloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is happening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him skyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of the plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He casually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has sent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.With samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded him off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The other guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber flashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.31 EXT SARLACC PITA bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and begins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs him and pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.32 INT SAIL BARGEJabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the guards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures watching the action from the window are in an uproar.33 EXT SKIFF Luke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of the Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.LUKEEasy, Chewie.At that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts from a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the deck of the rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately above the Sarlacc pit.LANDOWhoa! Whoa! Help!34 EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGEWith two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his rocket pack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff.35 EXT SKIFFBoba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who has freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire, the young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty hunter's gun in half.Immediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck gun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown against the rail.HANChewie, you okay? Where is he?The Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.HANI'm okay, pal.For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from the wrist down. Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable and stands free.Another blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is knocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.LANDOHan! Chewie?HANLando!Luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets him. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young Jedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating the guards from their midst.Chewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han, guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards. Han searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold of the spear.Boba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the other skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his arm, and aims his lethal appendage.Chewie barks desperately at Han.HANBoba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?The space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand whacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams as his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a weak congratulations to Han.36 INT SAIL BARGELeia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and throws the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous neck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the chain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath the tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his scum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted Hutt's huge tail spasms through its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia struggles to free herself of her bondage.37 EXT SKIFFLuke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han extends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously from a rope on the prisoner's skiff.HANLando, grab it!LANDOLower it!HANI'm trying!A major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks, and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit. The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.HANWhoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.Chewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han extends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the pit.HANGrab it! L--Lando. Grab!Luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.The injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by lying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand moves him closer to his final reward.HANGrab it! Almost... You almost got it!Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let go of the spear.LANDOHold it! Whoa!Again Han extends the spear toward Lando.HANGently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.Lando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.HANChewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.LANDONo, wait! I thought you were blind!HANIt's all right. Trust me. Don't move.LANDOAll right! A little higher! Just a little higher!Han adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate fires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and Chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.HANChewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!38 EXT UPPER DECKThe deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention: Luke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber. The deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young Jedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more gunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge) racing for him, firing their laser pistols.39 INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECKLeia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby little droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.LEIACome on. We gotta get out of here quick.Artoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and screaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out one of the golden droid's eyes.THREEPIONot my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!Artoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream, crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye dangling from a wire) hurry off.40 EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGELuke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by guards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke turns to face another guard.LUKE (to Leia)Get the gun! Point it at the deck!Leia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels the gun around.LUKEPoint it at the deck!A laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain, but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the guards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He flexes the hand; it still works.Near the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves as Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.THREEPIOArtoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.Artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself, tumbling toward the sand.Luke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she has brought around to point down at the deck.LUKECome on!Luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers Leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun explodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.41 EXT SKIFF Han leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the deck. Luke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.LUKELet's go! And don't forget the droids.LANDOWe're on our way.The Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge craft is on fire.42 EXT SAND DUNEThreepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next to it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire. With a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled from the sand.43 EXT DUNE SEAThe little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues its chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the barge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration.44 EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREAA ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR THE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand, pressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each supporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his wound.Soon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It is the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing and a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.HANI don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!LEIAThat's all any of us can see.HAN (blinking)Then I guess I'm getting better.As soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the wind dies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition. Threepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM.HAN (turning to Luke)I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.LUKE (shrugging it off)I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.HANNo, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!Luke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior, mussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.LUKE (moving to his ship)I'll see you back at the fleet.HANWhy don't you leave that crate and come with us?LUKEI have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.Luke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.HAN(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's betrayal and subsequent aide)Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.LANDOFigured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.LEIAHe means "You're welcome."LANDOCome on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.44A EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE The desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing appears and peels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON appears as a dot and grows huge, to roar directly over the CAMERA.45 INT X-WING - COCKPITLuke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside the canopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the MILLENNIUM FALCON.LUKEI'll meet you back at the fleet.LEIA (over comlink)Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.LUKEI will.HAN (over comlink)Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.A message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of Luke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he pulls a black glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.LUKEThat's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.46 EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDORA Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet rest in space above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor, Endor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle toward the Death Star.47 INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAYLord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous Death Star commander.48 INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STARThousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth docking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where the shuttle is coming to rest.The shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention with a momentous SNAP.Then, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak similar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's face is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow eyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme Ruler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.EMPEROR (to Vader)Rise, my friend.Vader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way along the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay kneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by several Imperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the procession.VADERThe Death Star will be completed on schedule.EMPERORYou have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.VADERYes, my Master.EMPERORPatience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring himbefore me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of theForce.VADERAs you wish.EMPEROREverything is proceeding as I have foreseen.He laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial troops.49 EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAHOnce again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps disconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.50 INT YODA'S HOUSEThe tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of the cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that clutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER. His manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.YODAHmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?Luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look has been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.LUKENo... of course not.YODA (tickled, chuckles)I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. (Points a crooked finger)When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?Yoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.YODASoon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.Yoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.LUKEMaster Yoda, you can't die.YODAStrong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.LUKEBut I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.YODANo more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.Yoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.LUKEThen I am a Jedi?YODA (shakes his head)Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.Luke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his courage. Finally he is able to ask.LUKEMaster Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?Yoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile creases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.YODAMmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.Luke watches him, each moment an eternity.LUKEYoda, I must know.YODAYour father he is.Luke reacts as if cut.YODATold you, did he?LUKEYes.A new look of concern crosses Yoda's face. He closes his eyes.YODAUnexpected this is, and unfortunate...LUKEUnfortunate that I know the truth?Yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.YODA (gathering all his strength)No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Notready for the burden were you.LUKEWell, I'm sorry.YODARemember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression.The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate yourdestiny.He beckons the young Jedi closer to him.YODALuke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I(cough),the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... (with great effort)There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.He catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green creature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he disappears in front of his eyes.51 EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING Luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting, but is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to help Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.LUKEI can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.BEN (OS)Yoda will always be with you.Luke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.LUKEObi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?The ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.LUKEYou told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.BENYou father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalkerand became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.LUKE (turning away, derisive)A certain point of view!BENLuke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our ownpoint of view.Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.BENI don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault.Ben pauses sadly.BENAnakin was a good friend.Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a stump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence.BENWhen I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.Luke is entranced.LUKEThere's still good in him.BENI also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.LUKEI can't do it, Ben.BENYou cannot escape your destiny.LUKEI tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.BENVader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.LUKEBut I had to help my friends.BEN (grinning at Luke's indignation)And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.LUKE (with sadness)I found out Darth Vader was my father.BENTo be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!LUKEI can't kill my own father.BENThen the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.LUKEYoda spoke of another.BENThe other he spoke of is your twin sister.LUKEBut I have no sister.BENHmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.LUKELeia! Leia's my sister.BENYour insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit.But they could be made to serve the Emperor.Luke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.BEN (continuing his narrative)When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible. So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.BEN (attempting to give solace with his words)The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy. Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well. That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause. That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.Luke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his sister.LUKEBut you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.BENShe hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!52 EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEETThe vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a dozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and battlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.53 INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOMHundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in the WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a holographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the nearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.MON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern but beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several military leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a salmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he finds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.Han peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused.HANWell, look at you, a general, huh? LANDO Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.HAN (sarcastic)Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they werelookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.LANDO (smiling)I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.HANWell, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.MON MOTHMAThe Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.This causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the Death Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the center of the room.MON MOTHMAThe data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.A volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to Leia as Chewie barks his amazement.MON MOTHMA (cont)Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.Admiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force field and the Moon of Endor.ACKBARYou can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weaponsystems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.There's a concerned murmur.ACKBAR (cont)General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attackHan turns to Lando with a look of respect.HANGood luck.Lando nods his thanks.HANYou're gonna need it.ACKBARGeneral Madine.Madine moves center stage.GENERAL MADINEWe have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secretImperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.The assembly begins to mumble among themselves.THREEPIOSounds dangerous.LEIA (to Han)I wonder who they found to pull that off.GENERAL MADINEGeneral Solo, is your strike team assembled?Leia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration.HANUh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.Chewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers. Han looks up at him.HANWell, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.Chewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.HAN (smiles)That's one.LEIAUh, General... count me in.VOICE (OS)I'm with you, too!They turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more cheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands Luke. Han and Leia are surprised and delighted.Leia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change in him and looks into his eyes questioningly.LEIA What is it?LUKE (hesitant)Ask me again sometime.Han, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks up.HANLuke.LUKEHi, Han... Chewie.Artoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio. THREEPIO"Exciting" is hardly the word I would use.54 INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAYThe Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, which looks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast docking bay. Chewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads Artoo and Threepio up the shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel strike team loading weapons and supplies. Lando turns to face Han. Luke and Leia have said their good-byes and start up the ramp.HANLook. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She'sthe fastest ship in the fleet.LANDOAll right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her.She-she won't get a scratch. All right?HAN (looks at him warmly)Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.LANDOLook, would you get going, you pirate.Han and Lando pause, then exchange salutes.LANDOGood luck.HANYou, too.Han goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns away.55 INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPITLuke is working on a back control panel as Han comes in and takes the pilot's seat. Chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to figure out all the Imperial controls.HANYou got her warmed?LUKEYeah, she's comin' up.Chewie growls a complaint.HANNo. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie.Leia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.Chewie barks and hits some switches. Han's glance has stuck on something out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him gently.LEIAHey, are you awake?HANYeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.Chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the Falcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han's shoulder.LEIA (softly)Come on, General, let's move.Han snaps back to life.HANRight. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?LUKEAll set.THREEPIOHere we go again.HANAll right, hang on.56 EXT SPACE - THE REBEL FLEETThe stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the Headquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms off into space.57 INT EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOMThe converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of light at the far end. There the Emperor sits in an elaborate control chair before a large window which looks out across the half-completed Death Star to the giant green moon of Endor.Darth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council, cautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After several tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.VADERWhat is thy bidding, my Master?EMPERORSend the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.VADERWhat of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?EMPERORIt is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.VADERYes, my Master.Vader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor walks toward the waiting council members.58 EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOONThere is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as construction proceeds on the Death Star. Transports, TIE fighters, and a few Star Destroyers move about. Now the huge Super Star Destroyer announces itself with a low roar and soon fills the frame.59 INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPITHan looks back at Luke and Leia as Chewie flips several switches. Through the viewscreen, the Death Star and the huge Super Star Destroyer can be seen.HANIf they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.Chewie growls his agreement.CONTROLLER (over radio)We have you on our screen now. Please identify.HANShuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.CONTROLLER (over radio)Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.HANTransmission commencing.Leia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed transmission begins.LEIANow we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.HANIt'll work. It'll work.Chewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star Destroyer that looms ever larger before them.LUKEVader's on that ship.HANNow don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.Chewie barks a question.HANI don't know. Fly casual.LUKEI'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.HANIt's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.Chewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out the window.60 INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGELord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death Star. Now, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. After a moment of stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL PIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen earlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach.VADERWhere is that shuttle going?PIETT (into comlink)Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?PILOT VOICE (HAN) (filtered)Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.The Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.VADERDo they have a code clearance?PIETTIt's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.Vader looks upward, as he senses Luke's presence.PIETTShall I hold them?VADERNo. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.PIETT (surprised)As you wish, my lord.(to controller)Carry on.Piett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.61 INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPITThe group waits tensely.HANThey're not goin' for it, Chewie.CONTROLLER (filtered)Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow yourpresent course.Everyone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks worried. Chewie barks.HANOkay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.62 EXT SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDORThe stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary Moon.63 EXT FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDORThe stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark, primeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.On an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a steep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and Luke. The troops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and Threepio bringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.Up ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly to the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. Han and Luke crawl up to take a look.THREEPIOOh, I told you it was dangerous here.THEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering through bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked nearby.LEIAShall we try and go around?HANIt'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.Leia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Chewie start quietly down.64 EXT FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITEThe four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far from the two Imperial scouts.HANChewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.LUKEQuietly, there might be more of them out there.HAN (grins)Hey... it's me.Han and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts. Luke and Leia exchange smiles.Han sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout whirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.SCOUT #1Go for help! Go!The second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to crash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight.LUKE (sarcastic)Great. Come on.Luke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol drawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where two more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied bike parked nearby.LEIAOver there! Two more of them!LUKEI see them. Wait, Leia!But Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She starts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.LUKE (pointing to the controls)Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!Luke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely avoiding two huge trees.HANHey, wait! Ahhh!He flips the remaining scout to the ground.65 EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASEThe two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia pursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from their bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets.LUKEMove closer!Leia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer through a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree, slowing the scout.LUKEGet alongside that one!Leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their steering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of the scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike and follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the remaining scout.LUKEGet him!The speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser cannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a glancing hit.LUKE (indicating the one ahead)Keep on that one! I'll take these two!With Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into the braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted out of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.The scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.FAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and rises out of sight.The scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes a glancing hit.Leia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion. But when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a conflagration.ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top and crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are moving as one.Another big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find Luke.Luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant, Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty slash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.66 EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FORESTHan, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait anxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed head and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.THREEPIOOh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!Han, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.Luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.HANLuke! Where's Leia?LUKE (concerned)What? She didn't come back?HANI thought she was with you.LUKEWe got separated.Luke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.LUKEHey, we better go look for her.Han nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.HANTake the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.LUKECome on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners.Luke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the squad proceeds in another.THREEPIODon't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do.They move off into the woods.THREEPIO (to Artoo)And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!67 EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITEA strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into view. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat puzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up and stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where she is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and disheveled.The Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a defensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins poking her with the sharp point of the spear.LEIACut it out!She stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.LEIAI'm not gonna hurt you.Leia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of her speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.LEIAWell, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is.She puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from her fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log beside her.LEIAWell, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.Wicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia pats the log again.LEIAI promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.More growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.LEIAAll right. You want something to eat?She takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him. Wicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously toward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.LEIAThat's right. Come on. Hmmm?Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps back, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her and chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.LEIALook, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?Reassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to sniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning to Leia.LEIAWhat is it?Suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears underneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the forest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL SCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches out his hand for her weapon.SCOUT #lFreeze! Come on, get up!She hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage in front of the log.SCOUT #1Go get your ride and take her back to base.SCOUT #2Yes, sir.The second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled. Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol, and the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and hits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's bike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once more. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards Leia with new respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking around all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the dense foliage.LEIACome on, let's get outta here.As they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and tugs at Leia to follow him.68 INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWERDarth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and private elevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's path.GUARDHalt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.VADER (raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the Force)The Emperor will see me, now!GUARD(repeating Vader's command)The Emperor will see you, now.69 INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOMTwo red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens to reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. It appears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. He waits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his back to the Dark Lord.EMPERORI told you to remain on the command ship.VADERA small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.EMPEROR (no surprise)Yes, I know.VADER (after a beat)My son is with them.EMPEROR (very cool)Are you sure?VADERI have felt him, my Master.EMPERORStrange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, LordVader.Vader knows what is being asked.VADERThey are clear, my Master.EMPERORThen you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.VADER (skeptical)He will come to me?EMPERORI have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you andthen you will bring him before me.VADER (bows)As you wish.The Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.70 EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITEHan, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move through the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia. Luke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.HAN (OS)Luke! Luke!Luke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred wreckage of a speeder bike in the grass.THREEPIOOh, Master Luke.LUKEThere's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.He tosses the helmet to Han.THREEPIOI'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.HAN (gravely)I hope she's alright.Chewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off through the foliage. HANWhat, Chewie? What? Chewie!The others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots along, Artoo whistles nervously.71 EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGEThe group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up to a tall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal hanging from it.HANHey, I don't get it.The rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.HAN (cont)Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.Chewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.LUKEChewie, wa-wait! Don't!Too late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake. SPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net, suspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of beeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a jumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth.HANNice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.LUKEWill you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. (trying to free an arm) Han, can you reach my lightsaber?HANYeah, sure.Artoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting appendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to squeeze an arm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to spin.THREEPIOArtoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!Artoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net, crashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they realize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long spear.HANWha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else.Han pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a second Ewok warrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to Han's face. He grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol.HANHey!LUKEHan, don't. It'll be all right.The Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets them take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.LUKEChewie, give 'em your crossbow.Artoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets free of the net and sits up, rattled.THREEPIOOh, my head. Oh, my goodness!When the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In a moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled bark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks begin to chant at Threepio.LUKEDo you understand anything they're saying?THREEPIOOh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms ofcommunication.HANWhat are you telling them?THREEPIOHello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. ButI do believe they think I am some sort of god.Chewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange "what next?" looks.HANWell, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?THREEPIOI beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.HANProper?!THREEPIOIt's against my programming to impersonate a deity.Han moves toward Threepio threateningly.HANWhy, you--Several Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face at the affront to their god. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is surrounded by a menacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He holds up his hands placatingly.HANMy mistake. He's an old friend of mine.72 EXT FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTSA procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. Their prisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long poles and wrapped in vines, cocoonlike.Each pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the captives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the remaining creatures.73 EXT FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FORESTThe procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the giant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into nothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts and rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes hold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other Ewoks follow suit.74 EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUAREThe procession winds its way into the village square. Mother Ewoks gather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the newcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han is placed on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others are leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently placed near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination. Han, Luke, and Chewie are less than fascinated.HANI have a really bad feeling about this.Chewie growls his concern.Suddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes out of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join Threepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A larger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber with great curiosity.Logray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing to the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit under Han with firewood.HANWhat did he say?THREEPIOI'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at abanquet in my honor.The drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut. Leia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening at the same moment the prisoners see her.HAN and LUKELeia!As she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.LEIAOh!THREEPIOYour Royal Highness.Artoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the assembled Ewoks and sighs.LEIABut these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.Threepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads negatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks some orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue with vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and Han .HANSomehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.LUKEThreepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.THREEPIOBut Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --LUKEJust tell them.Threepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps forward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and begins to concentrate.THREEPIOYou see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...Now the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the ground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.THREEPIO... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!The Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio calling out in total panic at his situation.THREEPIOPut me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!Chief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and release the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground. Logray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground. When the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo beeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him, finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The Ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group of Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and marveling at his height.THREEPIOOh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.LUKEThanks, Threepio.THREEPIO (still shaken)I...I never knew I had it in me.75 INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERSA glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room, creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a group of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne. The Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the two groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.Threepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's squeaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally murmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the Rebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War, mimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers. Throughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable in English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.THREEPIOYes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.Threepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.At the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.The drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer and screeches.HANWhat's going on?LEIAI don't know.Luke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something passes like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not notice.THREEPIOWonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.Several of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.HANJust what I always wanted.Chewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket clings to Han's leg.HAN (chuckles)Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. (to Wicket) Thank you. Okay.THREEPIOHe says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.Chewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders outside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.HANGood. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back.Han pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.HAN (cont)And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.76 EXT EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHTThe walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow and flicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill the soft night air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands staring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.LEIALuke, what's wrong?Luke turns and looks at her a long moment.LUKELeia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?LEIAJust a little bit. She died when I was very young.LUKEWhat do you remember?LEIAJust...images, really. Feelings.LUKETell me.LEIA(a little surprised at his insistence)She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.(looks up)Why are you asking me all this?He looks away.LUKEI have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.LEIALuke, tell me. What's troubling you?LUKEVader is here...now, on this moon.LEIA (alarmed)How do you know?LUKEI felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go.(facing her)As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.(beat)I have to face him.Leia is distraught, confused.LEIAWhy?Luke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.LUKEHe's my father.LEIAYour father?LUKEThere's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.Leia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.LEIALuke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.LUKEYou're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.Leia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she doesn't draw away. She begins to understand.LUKEYes. It's you Leia.LEIAI know. Somehow...I've always known.LUKEThen you know why I have to face him.LEIANo! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.LUKENo, you don't. You've always been strong.LEIABut, why must you confront him?LUKEBecause...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.They hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.Leia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed in moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and comes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only now that she is crying.HANHey, what's goin' on?Leia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.LEIANothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.HAN (angry)Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on?She looks up at him, struggling to control herself.LEIAI...I can't tell you.HAN (loses his temper)Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?LEIAI...HANAhhh...He starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.HANI'm sorry.LEIAHold me.Han gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.77 EXT FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORMAn Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands gracefully on the huge platform.Now, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks particularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.78 EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECKDarth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into an elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke, in binders, at their center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with complete calm.COMMANDERThis is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area.The commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.COMMANDERHe was armed only with this.Vader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the lightsaber from the commander's hand.VADERGood work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me.COMMANDERYes, my Lord.The officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing alone in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of the forest filter in upon them.VADERThe Emperor has been expecting you.LUKEI know, father.VADERSo, you have accepted the truth.LUREI've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.VADER (turning to face him)That name no longer has any meaning for me.LUKEIt is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.Vader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved hand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.VADER (indicating lightsaber)I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.Vader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming, brilliant blade.VADERYour skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.They stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.LUKECome with me.VADERObi-Wan once thought as you do.Luke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.VADERYou don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.LUKEI will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.VADERIf that is your destiny.LUKESearch your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate.VADERIt is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He isyour master now.Vader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand staring at one another for a long moment.LUKEThen my father is truly dead.79 EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING SHIELD GENERATORHan, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout, PAPLOO, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive Imperial shield generator. At the base of the generator is an Imperial landing platform. Leia studies the installation.LEIAThe main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. Thisisn't gonna be easy.HANHey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.Wicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They speak to Threepio.LEIAWhat's he saying?THREEPIOHe says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.80 EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEETThe vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. A giant Rebel Star Cruiser is up at the front, but now the Millennium Flacon roars up to a spot ahead of it, tiny in comparison.81 INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITLando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes some getting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon's cockpit. Lando speaks into his comlink.LANDOAdmiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.ACKBAR (VO)Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.Lando turns to his weird copilot.LANDODon't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time...(to himself) or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.The copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.ACKBAR (VO)All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.LANDOAll right. Stand by.He pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.82 EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEETWe are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon, then Ackbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge fleet ROARS INTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears.83 EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKERHan, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and Paploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is spread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that leads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes parked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an observation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in Ewok language.HANBack door, huh? Good idea.Wicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.HAN (cont)It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.LEIAWell, it only takes one to sound the alarm.HAN (with self-confident grin)Then we'll do it real quiet-like.Threepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks chatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up and scampers into the underbrush.Threepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short reply.THREEPIOOh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!LEIAQuiet.THREEPIOI'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.LEIAOh, no.84 EXT BUNKER - ENTRANCEPaploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial scouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body onto one of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at random. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous ROAR. Paploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in surprise.85 EXT RIDGEHan, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks.HAN (sighs)There goes our surprise attack.86 EXT BUNKERThe Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms into motion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest.SCOUTLook! Over there! Stop him!Three of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away in pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the door.87 EXT RIDGEHan, Leia, and Chewie exchange delighted looks.HANNot bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.Han and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker. Threepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.THREEPIOI have decided that we shall stay here.88 EXT FORESTPaploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's scary, but he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him and begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he rounds a tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the trees. A moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the still-flying, unoccupied bike.89 EXT BUNKERHan sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on the shoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms of the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the front, and taps out a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. Everyone stands out of sight, police-style, as the door opens. Han and Leia peek inside. No sign of life. The group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout behind.90 INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOMThe elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They walk across the dark space to stand before the throne, father and son side by side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to his Master.EMPERORWelcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.Luke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks down at Luke's binders.EMPERORYou no longer need those.The Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's binders fall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at his own hands, free now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck. He does nothing.EMPERORGuards, leave us.The red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.EMPEROR (to Luke)I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master.LUKEYou're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.The Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to Luke. The Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, Luke can perceive the evil visage within the hood.EMPEROROh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.VADERHis lightsaber.Vader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's lightsaber. The Emperor takes it.EMPERORAh, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.LUKEYou're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.The Emperor laughs.EMPERORPerhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.Luke looks up sharply.EMPERORYes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.Vader looks at Luke.LUKEYour overconfidence is your weakness.EMPERORYour faith in your friends is yours.VADERIt is pointless to resist, my son.The Emperor turns to face Luke.EMPEROR (angry)Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. (indicates Endor)Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...Luke reacts. The Emperor notes it.EMPEROR (cont)...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.Luke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword in the Emperor's hand.EMPEROROh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.91 INT BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOMHan, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door and enter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner.HANAll right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.The Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels. Leia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.LEIAHan! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.HANCharges! Come on, come on!Outside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more controllers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at the door.THREEPIO (to Wicket)Oh, my! They'll be captured!Wicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam into the forest.THREEPIOWa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.Inside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial commander enters.COMMANDERFreeze! You Rebel scum.Han and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on them and their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops surround them. Even more pour into the room, roughly disarming the Rebel contingent. Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks. They're helpless.92 EXT SPACE - ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEETThe Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon hang distant in space as the Rebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. The Millennium Falcon and several Rebel fighters are at the front as the space armada bears down on its target.93 INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITLando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the radio.LANDOAll wings report in.WEDGERed Leader standing by.GRAY LEADERGray Leader standing by.GREEN LEADERGreen Leader standing by.WEDGELock S-foils in attack positions.94 INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGEFrom the bridge of the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, Admiral Ackbar watches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen.ACKBARMay the Force be with us.95 INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITLando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points to the control panel and talks to Lando.LANDOWe've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, howcould they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.Lando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching Death Star as the implications of what he's just said sink in. He hits a switch on his comlink.LANDOBreak off the attack! The shield is still up.RED LEADER (VO)I get no reading. Are you sure?LANDOPull up! All craft pull up!The Falcon turns hard to the left. Out the window the stars and the Death Star move off right.96 EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR SHIELDThe Falcon and the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to avoid the unseen wall.97 INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGEAlarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes course abruptly. Other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the armada tries to halt its forward momentum.ACKBARTake evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.A Mon Calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls out to Ackbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to the controller.CONTROLLERAdmiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.On the screen can be seen the moon, Death Star, and the massive Imperial fleet. Ackbar moves to the comlink.ACKBARIt's a trap!LANDO (over comlink)Fighters coming in.There is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins.The Millennium Falcon and several squads of Rebel fighters head into an armada of TIE fighters. The sky explodes as a fierce dogfight ensues in and around the giant Rebel cruisers.REBEL PILOTThere's too many of them!LANDOAccelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.WEDGECopy, Gold Leader.The battle continues around the giant cruisers.98 INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOMThrough the round window behind the Emperor's throne can be seen the distant flashes of the space battle in progress.EMPERORCome, boy. See for yourself.The Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his side. Luke moves to look through a small section of the window.EMPERORFrom here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion.Luke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest of the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles, touches the lightsaber.EMPERORYou want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant.Vader watches Luke in his agony.LUKENo!EMPERORIt is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!99 EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKERHan, Leia, Chewie, and the rest of the strike team are led out of the bunker by their captors. The surrounding area, deserted before, is now crowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and hundreds of Imperial troops. The situation looks hopeless.STORMTROOPERAll right, move it! I said move it! Go on!From the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of beeps and whistles. And --THREEPIOHello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?BUNKER COMMANDERBring those two down here!STORMTROOPERLet's go!Artoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six Imperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids duck out of sight behind the tree.THREEPIOWell, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?STORMTROOPERFreeze! Don't move!THREEPIOWe surrender.The stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting quietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a band of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.THREEPIOOhhh! Stand back, Artoo.In a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK ATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and their awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting Ewoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the trees above.In the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for the cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes to the bunker door control panel.LEIAThe code's changed. We need Artoo!HANHere's the terminal.LEIA (into comlink)Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.Artoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround them. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of whistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked, runs after him.THREEPIOGoing? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!Biker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the little Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.A group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns and heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks abandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker moves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge logs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.A line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's foot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged behind.Two speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts round a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between two trees.100 EXT SPACEThe Falcon and other Rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat with Imperial TIE fighters, the battle raging around thecruisers of the Rebel armada.101 INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITLando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other Rebel squads.LANDOWatch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!WEDGERed Three, Red Two, pull in!RED TWOGot it!RED THREEThree of them coming in, twenty degrees!WEDGECut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate.Lando steers the Falcon through a complete flip, as his crew fires at the TIEs from the belly guns.NAVIGATORPressure's steady.The copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation.LANDOOnly the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for.102 EXT SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET The giant Imperial Star Destroyer waits silently some distance from the battle. The Emperor's huge Super Star Destroyer rests in the middle of the fleet.103 INT SUPER STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGEAdmiral Piett and two fleet commanders watch the battle at the huge window of the Super Star Destroyer bridge.COMMANDERWe're in attack position now, sir.PIETTHold here.COMMANDERWe're not going to attack?PIETTI have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.104 INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOMThe Emperor, Vader, and a horrified Luke watch the aerial battle fireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. Another Rebel ship explodes against the protective shield.EMPERORAs you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station.(into comlink)Fire at will, Commander.Luke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to the Rebel fleet beyond.105 INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOMControllers pull back on several switches. Commander Jerjerrod stands over them.JERJERRODFire!106 INT DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBERA button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. A huge beam of light emanates from a long shaft. Two stormtroopers stand to one side at a control panel.107 EXT DEATH STARThe giant laser dish on the completed half of the Death Star begins to glow; Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the aerial battle.108 EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLEThe air is thick with giant ships. In among them, Rebel X-wings dogfight with Imperial TIE fighters. Now an enormous Rebel cruiser is hit by the Death Star beam and is blown to dust.The Millennium Falcon roars over CAMERA, followed closely byseveral TIE fighters.109 INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITThe ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the Rebel cruiser. Lando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the Death Star firepower.LANDOThat blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! (into comlink)Home One, this is Gold Leader.110 INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGEAckbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks into the comlink.ACKBARWe saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.LANDOYou won't get another chance at this, Admiral.ACKBARWe have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.LANDOHan will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.111 EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKERArtoo and Threepio make it to the door, as Han and Leia provide cover fire.THREEPIOWe're coming!HANCome on! Come on!THREEPIOOh, Artoo, hurry!The little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A large explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally landing on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and smoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn around to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his appendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in his body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded companion.THREEPIOMy goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?HANWell, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.LEIAI'll cover you.Ewoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the stormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries. One is hit in the wing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers forward, shooting laser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all directions. Two Ewoks are struck down by laser blasts. One tries to awaken his friend, then realizes that he is dead.112 EXT SPACE - DEATH STARThe Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the Death Star's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging Imperial Star Destroyers.113 INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITLando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating giants. He's been yelling into the comlink.LANDO (desperately)Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point-blank range.ACKBARAt that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.LANDOWe'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few ofthem with us.The Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star Destroyers and begin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the giant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire.The control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack.REBEL PILOTShe's gonna blow!Y-WING PILOTI'm hit!The damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into the control tower, exploding.114 INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOMOut of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there is no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.EMPERORYour fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends.Luke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.EMPERORGood. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.Luke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He ignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber flashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the Emperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his father.115 EXT FORESTThe battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the Imperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs.A walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An Ewok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The logs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until it finally topples over with a great crash.A scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end of the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever-tightening circles until it runs out of rope andcrashes into the trees with a huge explosion.Chewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks cling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine, then hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window.WALKER PILOT #1Look!PILOT #2Get him off of there!The walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked out and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into the cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are thrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside, Chewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch with a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to listen to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.Chewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The Ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the battle in their favor.116 EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKERHan works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to hotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some stormtroopers.HANI think I got it. I got it!The three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a second blast door crashes down in front of the first.Han frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her shoulder hit by a laser blast.THREEPIOOh, Princess Leia, are you all right?HANLet's see.LEIAIt's not bad.STORMTROOPER (OS)Freeze!They freeze.THREEPIOOh, dear.STORMTROOPERDon't move!Leia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the two stormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock; the moment seems suspended in time.HANI love you.Another shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.LEIAI know.STORMTROOPERHands up! Stand up!Han stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back toward Leia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him, its deadly weapons aimed right at him.HAN (to Leia)Stay back.The hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and barks triumphantly.HANChewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea.117 INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOMLuke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even more vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi has grown stronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is forced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke stands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack.EMPEROR (laughing)Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you.Luke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and realizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.VADERObi-Wan has taught you well.LUKEI will not fight you, father.Vader walks back up the stairs to Luke.VADERYou are unwise to lower your defenses.Vader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader stands below him.LUKEYour thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.VADERThere is no conflict.LUKEYou couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy menow.VADERYou underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meetyour destiny.Vader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding the catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's platform. Vader moves to find him.EMPEROR (laughs)Good. Good.118 EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLEThe two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each other in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer explodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a series of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next to a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the Imperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack one of the larger Imperial ships.LANDOWatch out. Squad at .06.REBEL PILOTI'm on it, Gold Leader.WEDGEGood shot, Red Two.LANDONow...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.119 INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOMControllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an Imperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of static and interference.HAN/PILOT (VO)It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. Weneed reinforcements to continue the pursuit.The controllers cheer.CONTROL ROOM COMMANDERSend three squads to help. Open the back door.SECOND COMMANDERYes, sir.120 EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKERAs the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out, they're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their weapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the roof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their gunsas Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges.121 INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOMHan, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant explosive charges on the control panels and rush out.HANThrow me another charge.122 INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOMVader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne, searching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready.VADERYou cannot hide forever, Luke.LUKEI will not fight you.VADERGive yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, yourthoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...Vader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in anguish.VADERSister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wanwas wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the darkside, then perhaps she will.LUKENever-r-r!Luke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader fight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.The Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over theedge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat. The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.EMPERORGood! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father'splace at my side!Luke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical, black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his father. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in preparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away.LUKENever! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi,like my father before me.The Emperor's glee turns to rage.EMPERORSo be it...Jedi.123 EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKERHan and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across the clearing.HANMove! Move!A shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a spectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes along with the bunker.124 INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGEAckbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio.ACKBARThe shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.LANDOWe're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. (laughs)Told you they'd do it!The Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads toward the unfinished superstructure of the Death Star.125 INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOMLuke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The Emperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his arms toward Luke.EMPERORIf you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.Blinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's hands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the Force to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a moment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the young Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader struggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.EMPERORYoung fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.Luke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the Emperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into the bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.EMPERORYour feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price foryour lack of vision.Luke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward where Vader stands watching.LUKE (groans)Father, please. Help me.Again Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor, then back to Luke on the floor.EMPERORNow, young Skywalker...you will die.Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.Vader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength, Darth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it explodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is whipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the bottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away from the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant warrior are too weak to move.126 EXT/INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STARRebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death Star to the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of the giant battle station, followed by many TIE fighters.WEDGEI'm going in.LANDOHere goes nothing.Three X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed by the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters who continually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the pilot's faces as they race through the dark shaft.LANDONow lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.WEDGEForm up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.The fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still pursued by the TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from behind and explodes.LANDOSplit up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters tofollow you.PILOTCopy, Gold Leader.The Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE's, while Lando and Wedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and the Falcon scrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters continue to blast away at them.LANDOThat was too close.Nien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages on. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star Destroyer.127 INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGEACKBARWe've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.X-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship.128 INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGEAdmiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to the battle. They look concerned.CONTROLLERSir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.PIETTIntensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.The commander is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel fighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge.PIETTIntensify forward firepower!COMMANDERIt's too late!The Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer, causing a huge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control, crashes into the Death Star, and explodes.129 INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGEThere is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all sides. They cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up.130 INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAYChaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions as the Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over, unloading a heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions, confused and desperate to escape.In the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous deadweight of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial shuttle. Finally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions grow louder as Vader draws him closer.VADER (a whisper)Luke, help me take this mask off.LUREBut you'll die.VADERNothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes.Slowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face. There beneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the dying man smiles at the sight before him.ANAKIN (very weak)Now...go, my son. Leave me.LUKENo. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.ANAKINYou already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right.LUKEFather...I won't leave you.Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies.A huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a shuttle.131 EXT DEATH STARThe Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense superstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel Star Cruisers outside continually bombard the huge station. And each direct hit is answered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the station itself.132 INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT AND GUN PORTSLando's crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the dashing Baron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor shaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of the Falcon.WEDGEThere it is!LANDOAll right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.WEDGECopy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.The X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several proton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series of small explosions.The Falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously close, Lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the Falcon with a powerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main reactor.He maneuvers the Falcon out of the winding superstructure just ahead of the continuing chain of explosions.133 INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGEAckbar and other Mon Calamari lean on the railing of the bridge, watching the large screen showing the Death Star in the main briefing room.ACKBARMove the fleet away from the Death Star.134 EXT DEATH STARAn Imperial shuttle, with Luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out of the main docking bay as that entire section of the Death Star is blown away.Finally, just as it looks like the Falcon will not make it, Lando expertly pilots the craft out of the exploding superstructure and whizzes toward the Sanctuary Moon, only a moment before the Death Star supernovas into oblivion.135 INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPITLando and Nien Nunb laugh and cheer in relief.136 EXT ENDOR FORESTHan and Leia, Chewie, the droids, the Rebel troops, and the Ewoks all look to the sky as the Death Star reveals itself in a final flash of self-destruction. They all cheer.THREEPIOThey did it!Han looks town from the sky to Leia, a look of concern on his face. Leia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a silent voice.HANI'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.LEIAHe wasn't. I can feel it.HANYou love him, don't you?Leia smiles, puzzled.LEIAYes.HANAll right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.She realizes his misunderstanding.LEIAOh. No, it's not like that at all. He's my brother.Han is stunned by this news. She smiles, and they embrace.137 EXT ENDOR FOREST - NIGHTLuke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where his father's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet. He stands, watching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume Darth Vader -- Anakin Skywalker.In the sky above, fireworks explode and Rebel fighters zoom above the forest.138 EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHTA huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. Rebels and Ewoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating, singing, dancing, and laughing in the communal language of victory and liberation.Lando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by Han and Chewie. Then, finally, Luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and embrace him. They stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each other's touch, together to the end.Rebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original group of adventurers watch from the sidelines. Only Luke seems distracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.He looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling figures at the edge of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker.FADE OUTEND CREDITS OVER STAR FIELD
