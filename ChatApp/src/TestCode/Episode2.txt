EXT. SPACEA vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity.There is unrest in the Galactic SenateSeveral hundred solar systems underthe leadership of the rebel leader, CountDooku, have decalred their intentions tosecede from the Republic.This separatist movement has made itdifficult for the limited number ofJedi Kights to maintain peace andorder in the galaxy.Senator Amidala, the former Queen ofNaboo, is returning to Coruscantto vote on the critical issueof creating an army to assist theoverwhelmed Jedi.PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWNThe ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWNTwo Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden.One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.CAPTAIN TYPHOWe made it. I guess I was wrong,there was no danger at all.The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME ...She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Corde's eyes are open. She looks up at her.CORDE... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I... CORDE dies. PADME hugs her.AMIDALANo!... No!... No!...PADME lowers CORDE to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes.AMIDALAI should not have come back.CAPTAIN TYPHOM'Lady, you are still in danger.Amidala says nothing.CAPTAIN TYPHOThis vote is very important. You didyour duty and Corde did hers. Nowcome. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,please!She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them.EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off.INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAYThe vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.MAS AMEDDAOrder! We shall have order! The motionfor the Republic to commission an armytakes precedent, and that is what wewill vote on at this time.Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.PALPATINE...My esteemed colleagues, excuseme... I have just received sometragic and disturbing news. SenatorAmidala of the Naboo system... Hasbeen assassinated!There is a shock silence in the vast arena.PALPATINE(continued)This grievous blow is especiallypersonal to me. Before I becameChancellor, I served Amidala whenshe was Queen. She was a greatleader who fought for justice, notonly in this honourable assembly,but also on her home planet. Shewas so loved she could have beenelected queen for life. Shebelieved in public service, andshe fervently believed indemocracy. Her death is a greatloss to us all. We will all mournher as a relentless champion offreedom... and as a dear friend.There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.SENATOR ASK AAKHow many more Senators will diebefore this civil strife ends! Wemust confront these rebels now,and they need an army to do it.A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.AMBASSADOR DARSANAWhy weren't the Jedi able to stopthis assassination? We are nolonger safe, under their protection.Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.ORN FREE TAAThe Republic needs more securitynow! Before it comes to war.PALPATINEMust I remind the Senator fromMalastare that negotiations arecontinuing with the separatists.Peace is our objective here... notwar.The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.AMIDALAMy noble colleagues, I concur withthe Supreme Chancellor. At allcosts, we do not want war!The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and applause.PALPATINEIt is with great surprise andjoy the chair recognises theSenator from Naboo, PadmE Amidala.PADMELess than an hour ago, anassassination attempt was madeagainst my life. One of mybodyguards and six others wereruthlessly and senselesslymurdered. I was the target but,more importantly, I believe thissecurity measure before you, wasthe target. I have led theopposition to build an army... butthere is someone in this body whowill stop at nothing to assure it'spassage...Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.PADME (continuing)I warn you, if you vote to createthis army, war will follow. Ihave experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do not wish to do itagain.There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.PADMEWake up, Senators... you must wakeup! If you offer the separatistsviolence, they can only show usviolence in return! Many willlose their lives. All will losetheir freedom. This decisioncould very well destroy the veryfoundation of our great Republic.I pray you do not let fear pushyou into a disastrous decision.Vote down this security measure,which is nothing less than adeclaration of war! Does anyonehere want that? I cannot believethey do.There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.ORN FREE TAAMy motion to defer the vote mustbe dealt with first. That is therule of law.AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.PALPATINEDue to the lateness of the hourand the seriousness of thismotion, we will take up thesematters tomorrow. Until then, theSenate stands adjourned.EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY CHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, and MACE WINDU sit acress from him.PALPATINEI don't know how much longer I canhold off the vote, my friends.More and more star systems arejoining the separatists.MACE WINDUIf they do break away -PALPATINENo! I will not let that happen!MACE WINDUBut if they do, you must realisethere aren't enough Jedi toprotect the Republic. We arekeepers of the peace, not soldiers.PALPATINEMaster Yoda, do you think it willreally come to war?YODA closes his eyes.YODAWorse than war, I fear... Muchworse. PALPATINEWhat?MACE WINDUWhat do you sense, Master?YODAImpossible to see ... The Dark Sideclouds everything. But this I amsure of -(opens his eyes)Do their duty the Jedi will.A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears on the Chancellor's desk.DAR WACThe loyalist committee has arrived,my Lord. PALPATINESend them in.They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter the office.

To see you alivebrings warm feeling to my heart.PADMEThank you, Master Yoda. Do youhave any idea who was behindthe attack?MACE WINDUOur intelligence points todisgruntled spice miners, onthe moons of Naboo.PADMEI don't wish to disagree but Ithink that Count Dooku was behindit.There is a stir of surprise.MACE WINDUYou know, M'Lady, Count Dookuwas once a Jedi. He wouldn'tassassinate anyone, it is not inhis character.KI-ADI-MUNDIHe is a political idealist, nota murderer.YODAIn dark times nothing is what itappears to be, but the fact remainsSenator, in grave danger you are.PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.PALPATINECount Dooku has always avoidedany kind of conflict. It appearshe has no desire to start a war.Why would he kill you? To what end?PADME I don't know, but everything in mybeing tells me he was behind it... After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to Mace.PALPATINEMaster Jedi, may I suggest thatthe Senator be placed under theprotection of your graces.BAIL ORGANADo you think that is a wise useof manpower during these stressfultimes?PADMEChancellor, if I may comment, Ido not believe the...PALPATINE..."situation is that serious."No, but I do, Senator.PADMEChancellor, please! I don't wantany more guards!PALPATINEI realise all too well thatadditional security might bedisruptive for you, but perhapssomeone you are familiar with... anold friend like...

He has justreturned from a Border dispute onAnsion.PALPATINEYou must remember him, M'Lady...he watched over you during theblockade conflict.PADMEThis is not necessary, Chancellor.PALPATINEDo it for me, M'Lady, please. Iwill rest easier. We had a bigscare today. The thought oflosing you is unbearable.AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.MACE WINDUI will have Obi-Wan report to youimmediately, M'Lady.YODA leans into her ear.YODAToo little about yourself youworry, Senator, and too much aboutpolitics. Be mindful of yourdanger, PadmE.

SENATE APARTMENTS - TWILIGHTA graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant.INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR - EVENINGThe door to the apartment slides open.

Oh,dear, I'm afraid I've forgottenmyself again.PADME and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADME. She glances at him.OBI-WANIt's a great pleasure to see you again,M'Lady.PADMEIt has been far too long MasterKenobi. I'm so glad our pathshave crossed again... but I mustwarn you that I think yourpresence here is unnecessary.OBI-WANI'm sure the Jedi Council havetheir reasons.She moves in front of ANAKINPADMEAnnie??(stares)My goodness you've grown.They look at each other for a long moment.ANAKIN(trying to be smooth)So have you... grown morebeautiful, I mean... and muchshorter... for a Senator, I mean.OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADME laughs and shakes her head.PADMEOh Annie, you'll always be thatlittle boy I knew on Tatooine.This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO smile.OBI-WANOur presence will be invisible,M'Lady.CAPTAIN TYPHOI am very grateful you are here,Master Kenobi. The situation ismore dangerous than the Senatorwill admit.PADMEI don't need more security, I needanswers. I want to know who istrying to kill me.OBI-WAN(frowning)We're here to protect youSenator, not to start aninvestigation.ANAKINWe will find out who is trying tokill you PadmE, I promise you.He's done it again. He bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a dirty look.OBI-WANWe are not going to exceed ourmandate, my young Padawan learner.ANAKINI meant in the interest ofprotecting her, Master, of course.OBI-WANWe are not going through thisexercise again, Anakin. You willpay attention to my lead.ANAKINWhy?OBI-WANWhat??!!ANAKINWhy else do you think we wereassigned to her, if not to findthe killer? Protection is a jobfor local security... not Jedi.It's overkill, Master.Investigation is implied in ourmandate.OBI-WANWe will do as the Council hasinstructed, and you will learnyour place, young one.PADMEPerhaps with merely your presence,the mysteries surrounding thisthreat will be revealed. Now ifyou will excuse me I will retire.Everyone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORME leave the room.CAPTAIN TYPHOWell, I know I feel a lot betterhaving you here.I'll have an officer on everyfloor and I'll be at the commandcentre downstairs.JAR JAR Mesa busten wit happiness seeinYousa again, Annie.

Acertainty that is.MACE WINDUDo you think Obi-Wan's apprenticewill be able to bring balance tothe Force?YODAOnly if he chooses to follow hisdestiny.There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHTPADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off.INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHTANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt.The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.OBI-WANCaptain Typho has more than enoughmen downstairs. No assassin willtry that way. Any activity uphere?ANAKINQuiet as a tomb. I don't likejust waiting here for something tohappen to her.OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed.OBI-WANWhat's going on?ANAKIN shrugs.ANAKINShe covered that camera. I don'tthink she liked me watching her.OBI-WANWhat is she thinking?ANAKINShe programmed Artoo to warn us ifthere's an intruder.OBI-WANIt's not an intruder I'm worriedabout. There are many other waysto kill a Senator.ANAKINI know, but we also want to catchthis assassin. Don't we, Master?OBI-WANYou're using her as bait??ANAKINIt was her idea... No harm willcome to her. I can senseeverything going on in that room.Trust me.OBI-WANIt's too risky... and your sensesaren't that attuned, youngapprentice.ANAKINAnd yours are?OBI-WANPossibly.INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHTAs PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME.INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHTANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment.OBI-WAN You look tired.ANAKINI don't sleep well, anymore.OBI-WAN Because of your mother?ANAKINI don't know why I keep dreamingAbout her now. I haven't seen hersince I was little.OBI-WANDreams pass in time.ANAKINI'd rather dream of PadmE. JustBeing around her again is...intoxicating.OBI-WANMind your thoughts, Anakin, theybetray you. You've made acommitment to the Jedi order... acommitment not easily broken...and don't forget she's apolitician. They're not to betrusted.ANAKIN She's not like the others in theSenate, Master.OBI-WANIt's been my experience thatSenators are only focused onpleasing those who fund theircampaigns... and they are morethan willing to forget theniceties of democracy to get thosefunds.ANAKINNot another lecture, Master. Noton the economics of politics....It's too early in the morning... andbesides, you're generalising. TheChancellor doesn't appear tobe corrupt.OBI-WANPalpatine's a politician, I'veobserved that he is very clever atfollowing the passions andprejudices of the Senators.ANAKINI think he is a good man. Myinstincts are very positiveabout...ANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WANOBI-WANI sense it, too.INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHTARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHTOBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHTANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.ANAKINStay here!CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHTThe PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off. EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHTANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHTThe DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.OBI-WANI have a bad feeling about this.FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.ANAKINThat was wacky! I almost lost youin the traffic.OBI-WANWhat took you so long?ANAKINOh, you know, Master, I couldn'tfind a speeder I really liked,with an open cockpit... and withthe right speed capabilities...and then you know I had to get areally gonzo color...They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.OBI-WANIf you'd spend as much timeworking on your saber skills asyou do on your wit, young Padawan,you would rival Master Yoda as aswordsman.ANAKINI thought I already did.OBI-WANOnly in your mind, my very youngapprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.ANAKINSorry, I forgot you don't likeflying, Master.OBI-WANI don't mind flying... butwhat you're doing is suicide!They barely miss a commuter trainANAKINMaster, you know I've been flyingsince before I could walk. I'm verygood at this.OBI-WANJust slow down!ZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.OBI-WAN(continuing)Wait! Don't go in there!ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.OBI-WAN(continuing)You know I don't like it when youdo that!ANAKINSorry, Master. Don't worry, thisguy's gonna kill himself anyminute now!ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.OBI-WANWhat are you doing? He's gonnablast me!ANAKINRight - this isn't working.ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.OBI-WANThat was too close!ANAKINClear that!OBI-WANWhat??ANAKINClear the flag! We're losingpower! Hurry!OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.OBI-WANWhooooaaa! Don't do that! Idon't like it when you do that!ANAKINSo sorry, Master.They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.OBI-WANIt's dangerous near those powercouplings! Slow down! Don't gothrough there!Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.OBI-WAN(continuing)Yiiii, what are you doing?ANAKINSorry, Master!OBI-WAN(sarcastically)Oh, that was good...ANAKINThat was crazy!!!ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.ANAKIN(continuing)Ahh, damn.OBI-WANStop!!ANAKINNo, we can make it.ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.OBI-WANI'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'mcrazy.ANAKINBut it worked... we made it.OBI-WAN(angrily)It didn't work... we've stalled!And you almost got us killed!ANAKINI think we're still alive.ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.OBI-WAN(very angrily)It was stupid!ANAKIN(sheepishly)I could have made it...OBI-WAN(furious)But you didn't!!! And now we'velost him.Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.ANAKINNo we didn t...Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the rightOBI-WANWhere are you going?! He wentdown there, the other way.ANAKINThis is a shortcut... I think.OBI-WANWhat do you mean,  You think? What kind of shortcut?! He wentcompletely the other way! You velost him!ANAKINMaster, if we keep this chasegoing, that creep s gonna end updeep fried. Personally, I d verymuch like to find out who in thehell he is and who he s workingfor...OBI-WAN(sarcastic)Oh, so that s why we re going inthe wrong direction.ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.OBI-WAN(continuing)Well, you lost him.ANAKINI m deeply sorry, Master.ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.ANAKIN(continuing)Excuse me for a moment.ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zam s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeder s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.OBI-WAN has jumped into the driver s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger s seat.ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAM S hand. She grabs the Jedi s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of it s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter s speeder.Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHTZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him.

Obi-Wan isa great mentor. As wise as MasterYoda and as powerful as MasterWindu. I am truly thankful to behis apprentice. Only... althoughI'm a Padawan learner, in someways... a lot of ways...

A tray slides out of the console.PK-4Place the subject for analysis onthe sensot tray, please.OBI-WAN puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console. The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of OBI-WAN.OBI-WANIt's a toxic dart. I need to knowwhere it came from and who made it.PK-4One moment, please.Diagrams and .... appear on the screem, scrolling past at great speed. OBI-WAN watches as the screen goes blank.

STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAYThe great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings. To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.SERVERKeep moving! Keep moving!ARTOO slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. A SERVER sees him.FOOD SERVER(continuing)Hey! No Droids!ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless.ANAKINNo, no, Mom, no...He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.ANAKIN(continuing)What?PADMEYou seemed to be having anightmare.ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.PADME(continuing)Are you hungry?ANAKINThank you.PADMEWe went into lightspeed a whileago.ANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes.ANAKINI look forward to seeing Nabooagain. I've thought about it everyday since I left. It's by far themost beautiful place I've everseen...PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare. PADMEYou were just a little boy then.It may not be as you remember it;time changes your perception.ANAKINI think time has given me muchmore mature feelings to enhance myperception.PADMEIt must be difficult having swornyour life to the Jedi... not beingable to visit the places youlike... or do the things youlike...ANAKINOr be with the people I love.PADMEAre you allowed to love? Ithought that was forbidden for aJedi.ANAKINAttachment is forbidden.Possession is forbidden.Compassion, which I would defineas unconditional love, is centralto a Jedi's life, so you might saywe're encouraged to love.PADMEYou have changed so muchANAKINYou haven't changed a bit. You'reexactly the way I remember you inmy dreams. I doubt if Naboo haschanged much either.PADMEIt hasn't...ANAKINI can't wait to breathe the sweetbreeze that comes off the rollinghills. Whenever I try tovisualise the Force, those hillsare what I see.ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.ANAKIN(continuing)I love Naboo.There is an awkward moment.PADME(changing the subject)Were you dreaming about youmother earlier, weren't you?ANAKINYes... I left Tatooine so longago, my memory of her is fading.I don't want to lose it. RecentlyI've been seeing her in mydreams... vivid dreams... scarydreams.

On the steamed-up windowa it says "DEX'S DINER" in alien lettering. He goes inside.INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNINGA young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window.

Be right with ya!OBI-WAN sits in a booth.HERMIONE BAGWAYou want a cup of ardees?OBI-WANThank you.HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER appears. He is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely.DEXTER JETTSTERHey, ol' buddy!OBI-WANHey, Dex.DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just make it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them.DEXTER JETTSTERSo, my friend. What can I do forya?OBI-WANYou can tell me what this is.OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX'S eyes widen.

He puts the dart down between them.DEXTER JETTSTERThis baby belongs to them cloners.What you got here is a KaminoKyberdart.OBI-WANKamino Kyberdart... I wonder whyit didn't show up in any analysisarchive.DEXTER JETTSTERIt's these funny little cuts onthe side give it away...Those analysis droids you've gotover there only focus on symbols,you know. I should think you Jediwould have more respect for thedifference between knowledge andwisdom.OBI-WANWell, Dex, if droids could think, wewouldn't be here, would we?(laughing)Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.Is it part of the Republic?DEXTER JETTSTERNo, it's beyond the Outer Rim.I'd say about twelve parsecsoutside the Rishi Maze, toward thesouth. It should be easy to find,even for those droids in yourarchive to find. Those Kaminoanskeep to themselves. They'recloners. Damned good ones, too.OBI-WAN then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.OBI-WANCloners? Are they friendly?DEXTER JETTSTERIt depends.OBI-WANOn what, Dex?Dexter grins.

NABOO SPACEPORT - DAYThe Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.PADME, ANAKIN and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the Starfreighter and into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main plaza.EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOONThe speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.ANAKINIf I grew up here, I don't thinkI'd ever leave.PADME(laughing)I doubt that.ANAKINNo, really. When I started mytraining, I was very homesick andvery lonely. This city and my Momwere the only pleasant things Ihad to think about... The problemwas, the more I thought about myMom, the worse I felt. But Iwould feel better if I thoughtabout the palace - the way itshimmers in the sunlight - the waythe air always smells of flowers...PADME...and the soft sound of thedistant waterfalls. The firsttime I saw the Capital, I was veryyoung... I'd never seen awaterfall before. I though theywere so beautiful... I neverdreamed one day I'd live in thepalace.ANAKINWell, tell me, did you dream ofpower and politics when you werea little girl?PADME(laughing)No! That was the last thing Ithought of. My dream was to helpin the "Refugee Relief Movement."I never thought of running forelected office. But the morehistory I studied, the more Irealised how much good politicianscould do. So when I was eight, Ijoined the "ApprenticeLegislators", then later on becamea Senatorial advisor, with such apassion that, before I knew it, Iwas elected Queen. Partly becauseI scored so high on my educationcertificate, but for the most partit was my conviction that reformwas possible. I wasn't theyoungest Queen ever elected, butnow that I think back on it, I'mnot sure I was old enough. I'm notsure I was ready.ANAKINThe people you served thought youdid a good job. I heard theytried to amend the Constitution soyou could stay in office.PADMEPopular rule is not democracy,Annie. It gives the people whatthey want, not what they need.And, truthfully, I was relievedwhen my two terms were up. Sowere my parents. They worriedAbout me during the blockade andcouldn't wait for it all to beover. Actually, I was hoping tohave a family by now... Mysisters have the most amazing,wonderful kids... but when theQueen asked me to serve asSenator, I couldn't refuse her.ANAKINI agree! I think the Republicneeds you... I'm glad you choseto serve. I feel things are goingto happen in our generation thatwill change the galaxy in profoundways.PADMEI think so too.ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOONQUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS.

I onlyWish I could have served youbetter by staying on Coruscant forthe vote.SIO BIBBLEGiven the circumstances, Senator,you know it was the only decisionHer Highness could have made.QUEEN JAMILLIAHow many systems have joined CountDooku and the separatists?PADMEAbout two hundred. And more areleaving the Republic every day.If the Senate votes to create anarmy, I'm sure it's going to pushus into a civil war.SIO BIBBLEIt's unthinkable! There hasn'tbeen a full-scale war since theformation of the Republic!QUEEN JAMILLIADo you see any way, throughnegotiations, to bring theseparatists back into the Republic?PADMENot if they feel threatened. Theseparatists don't have an army,but if they are provoked, theywill move to defend themselves.I'm sure of that. And with no timeor money to build an army, myguess is they will turn to theCommerce Guilds or the TradeFederation for help.QUEEN JAMILLIAThe armies of commerce! Why hasNothing been done in the Senateto restrain them?PADMEI'm afraid that, despite theChancellor's best efforts, thereare still many bureaucrats,judges, and even Senators on thepayrolls of the Guilds.SIO BIBBLEIt's outrageous! After all ofthose hearings, and the four trials inthe Supreme Court, Nute Gunray isstill the Viceroy of the TradeFederation. Do those moneymongers control everything?QUEEN JAMILLIARemember, Counsellor, the courtswere able to reduce theFederation's armies. That's amove in the rightdirection.PADMEThere are rumours, Your Highness,that the Federation Army was notreduced as they were ordered.ANAKINThe Jedi have not been allowed toinvestigate. It would be to be toodangerous for the economy, we weretold.QUEEN JAMILLIAWe must keep our faith in theRepublic. The day we stopbelieving democracy can work isthe day we lose it.PADMELet's pray that day never comes.QUEEN JAMILLIAIn the meantime, we must consideryour own safety.SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.SIO BIBBLE(to Anakin)What is your suggestion, MasterJedi?PADMEAnakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.He's still a Padawan learner. Iwas thinking...ANAKIN(nettled)Hey, hold on a minute!PADMEExcuse me! I was thinking I wouldstay in the Lake Country. Thereare some places up there that arevery isolated.ANAKINExcuse me?! I am in charge ofsecurity here, M'Lady.SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here.PADMEAnnie, my life is at risk, andthis is my home. I know it verywell... that is why we're here.I think it would be wise for youto take advantage of my knowledgein this instance.ANAKIN(takes a deep breath)Sorry, M'Lady.SIO BIBBLE(to Anakin, amused)She is right. The Lake Country isthe most remote part of Naboo.Not many people and a clear viewof the surrounding terrain.QUEEN JAMILLIAPerfect. It's settled then.ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave.QUEEN JAMILLIA(continued)PadmE, I had an audience with yourfather yesterday. I told him whatwas happening. He hopes you willvisit your mother before youleave... your family's veryworried about you.PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase.EXT.

OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.JOCASTA NUDid you call for assistance?OBI-WAN(distracted in thought)Yes... yes, I did...JOCASTA NUHe has a powerful face, doesn'the? He was one of the mostbrilliant Jedi I have had theprivilege of knowing.OBI-WANI never understood why he quit.Only twenty Jedi have ever leftthe Order.JOCASTA NU(sighs)The Lost Twenty... and Count Dookuwas the most recent and the mostpainful. No one likes to talkabout it. His leaving was a greatloss to the Order.OBI-WANWhat happened?JOCASTA NUWell, one might say, he was alwaysa bit out of step with thedecisions of the Council... muchlike your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.OBI-WAN(surprised)Really?JOCASTA NUOh, yes. They were alike in manyways. Very individual thinkers...idealists...JOCASTA NU stares at the bustJOCASTA NU(continuingHe was always striving to becomea more powerful Jedi. He wantedto be the best. With a lightsaber,in the old style of fencing, hehad no match. His knowledge ofthe Force was... unique. In theend, I think he left because helost faith in the Republic. Hebelieved that politics werecorrupt, and he felt the Jedibetrayed themselves by serving thepoliticians. He always had veryhigh expectations of government.He disappeared for nine or tenyears, then he just showed uprecently as the head of theseparatist movement.OBI-WANInteresting... I'm still not sureI understand.JOCASTA NUWell, I'm sure you didn't call meover here for a history lesson.Are you having a problem, MasterKenobi?OBI-WANYes, I'm trying to find a planetsystem called Kamino. It doesn'tseem to show upon any of thearchive charts.JOCASTA NUKamino? It's not a system I'Mfamiliar with... Let me see...JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.JOCASTA NU(continuing)Are you sure you have the rightco-ordinates?OBI-WAN(nodding)According to my information, itshould be in this quadrantsomewhere... just south of theRishi Maze.JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.JOCASTA NUNo co-ordinates? It sounds like thekind of directions you'd get froma street tout... some old miner orFurbog trader.OBI-WANAll three actually.JOCASTA NUAre you sure it exists?OBI-WANAbsolutely.JOCASTA NULet me do a gravitational scan.OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU studt the star map hologram.JOCASTA NUThere are some inconsistencieshere. Maybe the planet you'relooking for was destroyed.OBI-WANWouldn't that be on record?JOCASTA NUIt ought to be. Unless it was veryrecent.(shakes her head)I hate to say it, but it lookslike the system you're searchingfor doesn't exist.OBI-WANThat's impossible... perhaps thearchives are incomplete.JOCASTA NUThe archives are comprehensive andtotally secure, my young Jedi.One thing you may be absolutelysure of - if an item does notappear in our records, it does notexist!OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back at the map.EXT.

The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.OBI-WANThis is where it ought to be...but it isn t. Gravity is pullingall the stars in this area inwardto this spot. There should be astar here... but there isn t.YODAMost interesting.

I guess it comes fromgrowing up on a desert planet.PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.PADME...We used to lie on the sand andlet the sun dry us... and try toguess the names of the birdssinging.ANAKINI don t like sand. It s coarseand rough and irritating, and itgets everywhere. Not like here.Here everything s soft... andsmooth...He touches her arm.

He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.ANAKINYou're always so serious. Alwayscarrying the weight of theuniverse on your shoulders.ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in.

The same ideals weare striving to make prominent.PADMEIf what you say is true, youshould stay in the Republic andhelp Chancellor Palpatine putthings right.DOOKUThe Chancellor means well, M'Ladybut he is incompetent. He haspromised to cut the bureaucracy,but the bureaucrats are strongerthan ever, no? Senator, theRepublic cannot be fixed. It istime to start over. Thedemocratic process in the Republicis a sham, a shell game playedon the voters. It will not be longbefore the cult of greed, calledthe Republic, will lose even thepretext of democracy and freedom.PADMEI cannot believe that.

GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAYANAKIN and PADME are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom.

Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA.

They are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling.INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA - DAYIn the gloomy tunnel, ANAKIN and PADME are tossed into an open cart. The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other.The DRIVER gets up onto his seat.ANAKINDon't be afraid.PADMEI'm not afraid to die. I've beendying a little bit each day sinceyou came back into my life.ANAKINWhat are you talking about?PADMEI love you.ANAKINYou love me?! I thought wedecided not to fall in love. Thatwe would be forced to live a lie.That it would destroy our lives...PADMEI think our lives are about to bedestroyed anyway. My love for youis a puzzle, Annie, for which Ihave no answers. I can't controlit... and now I don't care. Itruly, deeply love you, and beforewe die I want you to know.PADME leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for their lips to meet. They kiss.ANAKINI have no desire to be cured ofthis love either. Long or short,I vow to spend the rest of my lifewith you.They kiss again.The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arenaINT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAYThe great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADME and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADME is in the center.OBI-WANI was beginning to wonder if youhad gotten my message.ANAKINI retransmitted it as yourequested, Master. Then we decidedto come and rescue you.OBI-WANIt looks like you're going a goodjob so far.Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take their places.SUN RITThe felons before you have beenconvicted of espionage against theSovereign System of Geonosis.Their sentence of death is to becarried out in this public arenahenceforth.The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.POGGLELet the executions begin!The crowd goes wild.ANAKINI have a bad feeling about this.From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.OBI-WANTake the one the left. I'lltake the one on the right.ANAKINWhat about Padme?PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.OBI-WANIt looks like she's already on topof things.The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the postOBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.The NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.In the archducal box:NUTE GUNRAYFoul!! She can't do that... shoother or something!In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.ANAKINYou okay?PADME(nods, gasping)Sure! Well, sort of.ANAKINJump!!!The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.NUTE GUNRAYThis isn't how it's supposed tobe! Jango, finish her off.COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.COUNT DOOKU(smiling enigmatically)Patiece, Viceroy... she will die.Maybe this is the way it'ssupposed to end.OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAYARTOO BEEPSC-3POYes, it has been rather a longtime. Do you suppose something'shappened to them?ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.C-3PO(continuing)Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't thinkso. It looks a very dull planetto me. They should be backshortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAYIn the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit.COUNT DOOKUMaster Windu, how pleasant of youto join us. You're just in timefor the moment of truth. I wouldthink these two new boys of yourscould use a little more training.MACE WINDUSorry to disappoint you, Dooku.This party's over.MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.COUNT DOOKU(to Mace Windu)Brave, but stupid, my old Jedifriend. You're impossiblyoutnumbered.MACE WINDUI don't think so. One Jedi has tobe worth a hundred Geonosians.COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.COUNT DOOKUIt wasn't the Geonosians I wasthinking about. How well do youthink one Jedi will hold upagainst a thousand battle droids?COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.INT.

Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are retreating into the arena.ANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground.MACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.OBI-WANSomeone's got to - shut down -these droids.MACE WINDUDon't worry! It's being - takencare of!EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAYKI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Battle Starships.

Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.PLO KOONWe've done it! Now we have achance!Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.KI-ADI-MUNDIThe system's off but they're stillactive. That's a new feature. Theyare independent of the controlsystem.EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAYMACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS.

He picks it up.KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.COUNT DOOKUMaster Windu!Silence.COUNT DOOKU(continuing)You have fought gallantly. Worthyof recognition in the historyarchives of the Jedi Order. Nowit is finished.(pauses briefly)Surrender - and your lives will be spared.MACE WINDUWe will not be hostages for you tobarter with Dooku.COUNT DOOKUThen, I'm sorry, old friend. Youwill have to be destroyed.The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.PADMELook!Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.YODACome on - hurry! Hurry!The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.EXT.

GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAYOBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.OBI-WANHold on! Look over there...Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.ANAKINIt's Dooku, go after him!The PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.ANAKIN(continuing)Padme!!!ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.ANAKIN(continuing; to pilot)Put the ship down! Down!OBI-WANNo! Forget her. We have to goafter Dooku.ANAKINNo we're not!! Land this ship!OBI-WANDon't let your personal feelingsget in the way.

Look.ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS.OBI-WAN(continuing)Follow that speeder!On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAYCOUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.DROID CAPTAINYour Excellency!COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.COUNT DOOKUThat won't be necessary, Captain.Stand down. And leave them to me.The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.OBI-WAN(to Anakin)We move in together - you slowlyon the...ANAKINI'm taking him now!OBI-WANAnakin, no!ANAKINYou'll pay for all the Jedi you'vekilled today, Dooku.ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WANCOUNT DOOKUKenobi, isn't it? As you can see,my Jedi powers are far beyondyours. Now, back down.OBI-WANI don't think so.OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.COUNT DOOKUAh, but if I must.COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.COUNT DOOKU(continuing)I have spent the last ten yearslearning to use the power of theDark Side. It gives me infinitelygreater power.OBI-WANYou will have to prove it.OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.COUNT DOOKUGrand Master Kenobi, youdisappoint me. Yoda holds you insuch high esteem.COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.COUNT DOOKU(continuing)Surely you can do better...?(parries)No, I'm surprised. Has Jediswordsmanship degenerated soquickly, or are you trying to makefun of me?(cuts)Which is it?COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.COUNT DOOKU(continuing)come, come, Master Kenobi. Put meout of my misery.OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.COUNT DOOKU(continuing)That's brave of you, boy - butfoolish. I would have thoughtyou'd have learnt your lesson.ANAKINI'm a slow learner.And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.COUNT DOOKUYou have unusual powers, youngPadawan. But not enought to saveyou this time.ANAKINDon't bet on it!OBI-WANAnakin!OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.COUNT DOOKUMaster Yoda. At last we shallknow who is the most powerful.YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.YODACount Dooku. No interest incontests, do I have.COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.YODA(continuing)The end for you, Count, this is.COUNT DOOKU...Not yet...COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADME and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.PADMEAnakin!PADME runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.CLONE CAPTAINResistance is at an end, General.What are your orders ?YODA looks at him and sighs.EXT.
